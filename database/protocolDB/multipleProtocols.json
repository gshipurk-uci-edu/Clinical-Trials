        "DESCRIPTION": "This study will be a randomized phase III for patients with newly diagnosed co-deleted 1p/19q anaplastic glioma or high risk low grade glioma. The trial will only enroll patients with 1p/19q co-deletion. This study includes two arms as described in the \"Arms\" section. A dynamic allocation procedure will be used to allocate an equal number of patients to different arms (Arms A:B = 1:1). This procedure will balance the marginal distributions of the stratification factors among arms. The stratification factors that will be used are cooperative groups (EORTC vs. all North American groups), age (\u2264 50 vs. \\> 50), performance score (ECOG 0-1 vs. 2), and tumor grade (anaplastic glioma vs. low grade glioma).\n\nThe primary goal is to determine whether patients who receive radiotherapy with concomitant temozolomide (TMZ) followed by adjuvant temozolomide (RT + TMZ --\\> TMZ) (Arm B) have a marginally better progression free survival (PFS) as compared with patients who receive radiotherapy followed by PCV chemotherapy (RT --\\> PCV)(Arm A).\n\nSecondary Goals:\n\n1. Time to Progression - To determine whether patients who receive (RT + TMZ --\\> TMZ) have a significantly longer time to progression (clinical or radiographic progression) as compared with patients who receive radiotherapy followed by adjuvant PCV chemotherapy (RT --\\> PCV).\n2. Correlation between exploratory biomarkers and survival - To determine whether there is a difference in survival based on t(1;19)(q10, p10) translocation status and MGMT promoter hypermethylation status.\n3. Descriptive Comparisons of Additional Secondary Endpoints - To perform descriptive comparisons of additional secondary outcome endpoints, including overall survival, objective tumor response, prognostic factor analysis and quality of life.\n4. Toxicity - To determine the toxicity of the treatment in each arm and perform descriptive comparisons.\n5. Neurocognitive and Quality of Life (QOL) Effects - To determine the neurocognitive and QOL effects in patients treated on this protocol and correlate these results with outcome endpoints.\n6. Banking of Biospecimens and Neuroimaging Studies - To store blood products (i.e., plasma, DNA and buffy coat), tumor tissue and MRI/CT images for future scientific investigations.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 12 weeks for 1 year, then every 4 months for 2 years and then every 6 months until progressive disease or until the end of study participation.",
        "SUMMARY": "Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as temozolomide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. It is not yet known whether giving radiation with concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide versus radiation with adjuvant PCV is more effective in treating anaplastic glioma or low grade glioma.",

        "OUTCOME_DESCRIPTION": "The distribution of progression free survival for Arms A and B will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The hazard ratios and median progression free survival (PFS) will be estimated with their confidence intervals. The Cox proportional hazards model will be used to assess whether the distributions of progression survival times differ with respect to treatment regimen having adjusted for all stratification factors (cooperative groups, age, and performance score).

        "SUMMARY": "This phase III trial studies how well chemotherapy and radiation therapy work with or without atezolizumab in treating patients with localized muscle invasive bladder cancer. Radiation therapy uses high energy rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Chemotherapy drugs, such as gemcitabine, cisplatin, fluorouracil and mitomycin-C, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving chemotherapy with radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as atezolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving atezolizumab with radiation therapy and chemotherapy may work better in treating patients with localized muscle invasive bladder cancer compared to radiation therapy and chemotherapy without atezolizumab.",

        "DESCRIPTION": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine whether de-intensified chemoradiation for early stage squamous cell carcinoma of the anal canal (SCCA) is able to maintain excellent 2-year disease control of 85% or higher while improving anorectal health-related quality of life (HRQL), compared to standard-dose chemoradiation therapy (CRT), as measured by the change in the Fecal Incontinence Quality of Life scale (FIQoL) instrument coping/behavior domain from baseline to 1 year.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To compare changes in patient-reported outcomes (as per Fecal Incontinence Severity Index \\[FISI\\], Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System \\[PROMIS\\], International Index of Erectile Function \\[IIEF\\], Sexual Function-Vaginal Changes Questionnaire \\[SVQ\\], and Vaginal Assessment Scale \\[VAS\\]/Vulvar Assessment Scale \\[VuAS\\] instruments) between the experimental and control arm.\n\nII. To compare patterns of failure (local and regional relapse versus distant; in-field versus out-of-field of radiation), disease control, and overall survival between experimental and control arm.\n\nIII. To correlate vaginal dilator use during radiation delivery with sexual function.\n\nIV. To measure changes in serum total testosterone from baseline to up to 12 months after radiation.\n\nV. To validate the utility of image features of inguinal and pelvic lymph nodes obtained prior to treatment as a prognostic indicator that can identify patients with early-stage anal squamous cell carcinoma for whom treatment with de-intensified chemoradiation is appropriate.\n\nVI. To determine whether an online, interactive educational tool (eContour) may improve the quality of radiation target delineation for anal cancer.\n\nVII. To determine the incidence of and predictors for cardiovascular toxicity in patients receiving fluorouracil (5-FU) or capecitabine.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.\n\nARM A (STANDARD-DOSE CHEMORADIATION): Patients undergo 28 fractions of intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). Within 24 hours, patients also receive mitomycin intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes or less on day 1 and either fluorouracil IV over 24 hours on days 1-4 and 29-32 or capecitabine orally (PO) twice daily (BID) 5 days per week (Monday - Friday) until completion of IMRT in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nARM B (DE-INTENSIFIED CHEMORADIATION): Patients undergo 20 or 23 fractions of IMRT. Within 24 hours, patients also receive mitomycin IV over 30 minutes or less on day 1 and either fluorouracil IV over 24 hours on days 1-4 or capecitabine PO BID 5 days per week (Monday - Friday) until completion of IMRT in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 6 weeks, every 3 months for years 1-2, every 6 months for year 3, then annually for years 4-5.",
        "SUMMARY": "This phase II trial studies how well lower-dose chemotherapy plus radiation (chemoradiation) therapy works in comparison to standard-dose chemoradiation in treating patients with early-stage anal cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as mitomycin, fluorouracil, and capecitabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Giving chemotherapy with radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells. This study may help doctors find out if lower-dose chemoradiation is as effective and has fewer side effects than standard-dose chemoradiation, which is the usual approach for treatment of this cancer type.",

        "DESCRIPTION": "Lung cancer is one of the most common types of cancer and is also the most common cause of death from cancer. NSCLC accounts for 85 percent (%) to 90% of lung cancers. Lazertinib is an oral, highly potent, mutant-selective, and irreversible EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) targeting both, the T790M mutation and activating EGFR mutations while sparing wild type EGFR. JNJ-61186372 (also referred to as amivantamab), is a low fucose, fully human immunoglobulin G1(IgG1)-based bispecific antibody. As a third generation EGFR-TKI targeting activating EGFR mutations, lazertinib has a distinct mechanism of action from JNJ-61186372, which targets the extracellular domains of both the EGFR and cMet proteins. The distinct mechanisms of action of lazertinib and JNJ-61186372 suggests potential to improve clinical outcomes through the combination of these two molecules.

        "SUMMARY": "This phase II trial studies how well radium-223 dichloride and paclitaxel work in treating patients with advanced breast cancer that has spread to the bones. Radium-223 dichloride is a radioactive drug that behaves in a similar way to calcium and collects in cancer that has spread to the bones (bone metastases). The radioactive particles in radium-223 dichloride act on bone metastases, killing the tumor cells and reducing the pain that they can cause. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving radium-223 dichloride and paclitaxel may work better in treating patients with metastatic breast cancer compared to paclitaxel alone.",

As part of the enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be counseled on the risk of interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need to be prescribed or if the patient is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or herbal product. The primary elimination mechanism of avelumab is proteolytic degradation, thus there are no contraindicated medications with respect to avelumab\n* Patients who cannot discontinue concomitant proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) prior to starting M3814 and avelumab. These must be discontinued \\>= 5 days prior to starting M3814 and avelumab. Patients do not need to discontinue calcium carbonate. H2 blockers are allowed provided they are taken at least 2 hours after M3814 dose\n* Patients receiving sorivudine or any chemically related analogues (such as brivudine) and not able to discontinue prior to starting M3814 and avelumab are excluded\n* Pregnant and lactating women are excluded from this study because M3814 and avelumab are agents with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with M3814 and avelumab, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with M3814 and avelumab\n* Patients who have received live vaccination within 30 days before starting M3814 and avelumab",

        "SUMMARY": "This phase I/II trial studies the best dose and side effects of peposertib and to see how well it works with avelumab and hypofractionated radiation therapy in treating patients with solid tumors and hepatobiliary malignancies that have spread to other places in the body (advanced/metastatic). Peposertib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as avelumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Hypofractionated radiation therapy delivers higher doses of radiation therapy over a shorter period of time and may kill more tumor cells and have fewer side effects. Giving peposertib in combination with avelumab and hypofractionated radiation therapy may work better than other standard chemotherapy, hormonal, targeted, or immunotherapy medicines available in treating patients with solid tumors and hepatobiliary malignancies.",

        "DESCRIPTION": "Background:\n\n* There are more than 130 identified primary tumors of the central nervous system (CNS). Most have an annual incidence of less than 1000 in the United States.\n* Given the rarity of each of the tumors listed above, there is a paucity of proven therapies. Most of these neoplasms are treated with maximum surgical resection followed by treatment with external beam radiotherapy. With few exceptions (medulloblastoma, adult ependymoma), there are no effective systemic regimens and even in chemotherapy sensitive disease, most patients with recurrence eventually have no remaining salvage treatments available.\n* In the setting of this unmet need, we propose to create a basket protocol that will evaluate the efficacy of the PD-1 inhibitor, nivolumab, in patients with refractory rare central nervous system neoplasms.\n* This study seeks to establish effective therapies at recurrence in patients with rare CNS tumors. We hypothesize that this therapy will improve progression free survival and/or objective responses.\n* It will be important to determine whether any determined survival benefit is associated with improvements in symptoms or does a worsening of symptoms offset the increase in survival. Precedence exists for measuring non-therapeutic endpoints in oncology research, and specifically in studies evaluating therapeutic benefit in patients with CNS tumors. There have been efforts in neuro-oncology to evaluate secondary endpoints using validated instruments as an additional indicator of benefit. The M.D. Anderson Symptom Inventory-Brain Tumor Module (MDASI-BT) and Spine Tumor Module (MDASI-SP) allow for the self-reporting of symptom severity and interference with daily activities for patients with either brain or spinal cord tumors. The availability of validated instruments provides an opportunity to prospectively assess the impact of treatment, both positive and negative, on patients.\n\nObjective:\n\nDetermine the efficacy of nivolumab in a variety of recurrent, refractory primary central nervous system tumors as measured by disease control rate (confirmed CR/PR or durable SD for at least 6 months).\n\nEligibility:\n\n* Documented recurrent or progressive disease that corresponds to one of the tumors eligible for testing.\n* Age greater than or equal to 18 years of age.\n* Karnofsky Performance greater than or equal to 70%.\n* Tumor tissue available for central review to confirm morphologic diagnosis\n* Tumor tissue or slides must be available for central molecular and immune profiling.\n\nDesign:\n\n* This is an open label phase II clinical trial. Patients will be treated with the immune checkpoint inhibitor, nivolumab, at a standard dose of 240 mg intravenously every 2 weeks (+/- 3 days) for cycles 1 through 2, then doses of 480 mg every 4 weeks (+/- 3 days) for a total of 14 additional doses (cycles). A maximum of 18 treatments will be given (64 weeks).\n* A cycle will be defined as 4 weeks and patients will undergo efficacy assessments using MR imaging (and/or other imaging tests if applicable) every 2 cycles. Toxicity assessments will occur before the initiation of each cycle and patient outcomes measures (PROs) will be completed at the time of each imaging study (every 2 cycles) but prior to the patient being informed of the imaging results.\n* After completion of the planned treatment course or if treatment was stopped because of toxicity, patients will undergo imaging evaluations and PRO measurements every 8 weeks (or 2 months) for one year, then every 3 months for the next year, then every 4\n\nmonths for the next year and then every 6 months while the patient remains on the protocol. Patients off treatment because of disease progression will not undergo future imaging or PRO assessments on this protocol.\n\n* Bayesian Optimal Phase 2 design (BOP2), will be used to conduct this phase II trial in patients with a variety of recurrent, refractory primary central nervous system tumors.\n* The study will be comprised of 2 disease cohorts: heavily pretreated (defined as having received 3 or more prior therapies) and non-heavily pretreated (defined as having received up to 2 prior therapies). Each cohort will be evaluated\n\nindependently for efficacy.",
        "SUMMARY": "Background:\n\nMore than 130 primary tumors of the central nervous system (CNS) have been identified. Most affect less than 1,000 people in the United States each year. Because these tumors are so rare, there are few proven therapies. This study will test whether the immunotherapy drug nivolumab is an effective treatment for people with rare CNS tumors.\n\nObjectives:\n\nTo learn if stimulating the immune system using the drug nivolumab can shrink tumors in people with rare CNS (brain or spine) tumors or increase the time it takes for these tumors to grow or spread.\n\nEligibility:\n\nAdults whose rare CNS tumor has returned.\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will be screened:\n\n* Heart and blood tests\n* Physical and neurological exam\n* Hepatitis tests\n* Pregnancy test\n* MRI. They will lay in a machine that takes pictures.\n* Tumor tissue sample. This can be from a previous procedure.\n\nAt the start of the study, participants will have blood tests. They will answer questions about their symptoms and their quality of life.\n\nParticipants will get nivolumab in a vein every 2 weeks for up to 64 weeks.\n\nParticipants will have monthly blood tests. Every other month they will have an MRI and a neurologic function test. They will also answer questions about their quality of life.\n\nGenetic tests will be done on participants' tumor tissue. Participants will be contacted if any clinically important results are found.\n\nAfter treatment ends, participants will be monitored for up to 5 years. They will have a series of MRIs and neurological function tests. They will be asked to report any symptoms they experience....",

        "SUMMARY": "This phase III trial compares early treatment with venetoclax and obinutuzumab versus delayed treatment with venetoclax and obinutuzumab in patients with newly diagnosed high-risk chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma. Venetoclax is in a class of medications called B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) inhibitors. It may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking Bcl-2, a protein needed for cancer cell survival. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as obinutuzumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Starting treatment with the venetoclax and obinutuzumab early (before patients have symptoms) may have better outcomes for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma compared to starting treatment with the venetoclax and obinutuzumab after patients show symptoms.",

Thyroid stimulating hormone within institutional limits, or T4 is within institutional limits if TSH is outside of institutional limits\n* Female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative urine or serum pregnancy within 72 hours before receiving the first dose of pembrolizumab. If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required.\n* The effects of pembrolizumab and ionizing radiation on the developing human fetus are known to have the potential for congenital abnormalities and fetal harm. Women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry, for the duration of study participation, and for 120 days following completion of therapy. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.\n\n  1.

Patients on suppressive therapy are eligible.\n* Patients must not be on active immunosuppression within 7 days prior to the first dose of treatment.\n* Patients must not have a history of (non-infectious) pneumonitis that required steroids or has current pneumonitis.\n* Ability to understand and willingness to sign a written informed consent document\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 2 weeks prior to initiation of study therapy.\n* Patients who have not recovered from adverse events due to prior anti-cancer therapy administered.\n* Patients must not be receiving any other investigational agents.\n* Patients with a history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to pembrolizumab.\n* Patients with uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.\n* Patients must not be pregnant or nursing due to the potential for congenital abnormalities and the potential of this regimen to harm nursing infants.\n\n  1. Pembrolizumab can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman based on the biological mechanism that PD-1/PD-L1 signaling is an important pathway in the maintenance of pregnancy through induction of maternal immune tolerance to fetal tissue.1 Human IgG4 is known to cross the placenta. Animal models have found that blocking PD-L1 signaling increases the risk of fetal loss, and immune-mediated disorders occurred in PD-1 knockout mice.\n  2. Although there are not data on the presence of pembrolizumab in either animal or human milk or its effects on breastfed children or on milk production, there is a potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed children. Thus, women are advised not to breastfeed during treatment with pembrolizumab and for 120 days after the final dose.\n* Patients with disease amenable to curative intent surgery.\n* Patient has had a prior monoclonal antibody for treatment of sarcoma, unless the current regimen is checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy.\n* Patient has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment; exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin.\n* Patient has an active autoimmune disease requiring systemic treatment within the past 3 months or a documented history of clinically severe autoimmune disease, or a syndrome that requires systemic steroids or immunosuppressive agents. Patients with resolved childhood asthma, hypothyroidism stable on hormone replacement, Sjogren's syndrome, or with vitiligo would not be excluded.

        "SUMMARY": "This phase III trial studies how well trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) and tucatinib work in preventing breast cancer from coming back (relapsing) in patients with high risk, HER2 positive breast cancer. T-DM1 is a monoclonal antibody, called trastuzumab, linked to a chemotherapy drug, called DM1. Trastuzumab is a form of targeted therapy because it attaches to specific molecules (receptors) on the surface of cancer cells, known as HER2 receptors, and delivers DM1 to kill them. Tucatinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving T-DM1 and tucatinib may work better in preventing breast cancer from relapsing in patients with HER2 positive breast cancer compared to T-DM1 alone.",

        "SUMMARY": "Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common cancer seen in pediatric oncology. The necessary chemotherapy for pediatric and adolescent and young adult (AYA) patients with ALL includes steroids, anthracyclines, asparaginase, and vincristine. One of the most hepatotoxic chemotherapy agents is asparaginase, with treatment-associated hepatotoxicity (TAH) observed in up to 60% of patients. The frequency of TAH is increased in overweight or obese patients of Latino heritage. Carnitine is a naturally-derived compound that is produced in the liver and kidneys; it is found in certain foods, such as meat, poultry, fish, and some dairy products. Endogenous carnitine transports long-chain fatty acids into the mitochondria, where they are oxidized to produce energy, and acts as scavengers of oxygen free radicals. Thus, carnitine can reduce oxidative stress and modulate inflammatory response. Levocarnitine is a supplement form of carnitine used typically in the care and management of patients with carnitine deficiency. Pediatric and AYAs with ALL will be given oral levocarnitine as a supplement during their initial phases of treatment, when the most hepatotoxic agents are administered, to determine if the incidence of liver toxicity can be reduced or eliminated.",

        "SUMMARY": "This phase II/III trial studies the side effects of nivolumab and ipilimumab when given together with or without sargramostim and to see how well they work in treating patients with stage III-IV melanoma that cannot be removed by surgery (unresectable) and that may have spread from where it first started to nearby tissue, lymph nodes, or distant parts of the body (advanced). Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as ipilimumab and nivolumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Colony-stimulating factors, such as sargramostim, may increase the production of white blood cells. It is not yet known whether nivolumab and ipilimumab are more effective with or without sargramostim in treating patients with melanoma.",

Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as atezolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Radiation therapy, such as stereotactic body radiation therapy, uses special equipment to position a patient and deliver radiation to tumors with high precision. This method can kill tumor cells with fewer doses over a shorter period and cause less damage to normal tissue. Giving atezolizumab and radiation therapy may work better than radiation therapy alone in treating patients with early non-small cell lung cancer.",

        "DESCRIPTION": "Blocking antibodies targeting PD-1 have achieved remarkable results in the treatment of many types of tumors. However, based upon the rate of primary and secondary resistance to PD-1 blockade, it is apparent that additional immuno-regulatory mechanism(s) underlie tumor immune escape. Indeed, research shows that the TIM-3 pathway cooperates with PD-1 to maximize the suppression of effector TILs as well as promote resistance to anti-PD-1 therapy. Therefore, TIM-3 represents an ideal target with the potential to significantly improve and/or extend the therapeutic benefit of anti-PD-1 therapy to a greater number of patients.\n\nTIM3, LAG3, and PD-1 function as immune checkpoint receptors in the overlapping regulation of immune tolerance and have been shown to be co-overexpressed on the tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) from the participant samples of various solid tumors. Furthermore, emerging clinical data and preclinical data demonstrate co-expression of Tim-3, LAG-3, PD-1 often yield T cells' exhausted immunophenotype (ie, cytokine expression, proliferation etc.). Cancer cells take advantage of PD-1, TIM-3, and LAG-3 in inhibiting immune cells' function, and escape the immune surveillance. Based upon the overlapping expression profiles and immuno-regulatory functions, TIM-3 and LAG-3 mediated adaptive resistance, there is strong scientific rationale that simultaneous targeting of these checkpoint blockers, could potentially increase therapeutic benefit and may help to overcome the resistance arising due to anti-PD-(L)-1 therapy. Hence, this study will evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of BGB-A425 (anti TIM-3), LBL-007 (Anti-LAG-3) in combination with tislelizumab (anti PD-1) in patients with advanced solid tumors\n\nThis is an open-label, multicenter, nonrandomized Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trial. Phase 1 will determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) for the combination of BGB-A425 and Tislelizumab. Phase 2 safety lead-in will determine the RP2D for the combination of BGB-A425, Tislelizumab and/or LBL-007. Phase 2 dose expansion will continue to evaluate the safety but also focus on the efficacy of the doublet or triplet treatment combination in select tumor types.",

        "SUMMARY": "This phase II trial studies the effect of sacituzumab govitecan in treating patients with HER2-negative breast cancer that has spread to the brain (brain metastases). Sacituzumab govitecan is a monoclonal antibody, called sacituzumab, linked to a chemotherapy drug, called govitecan. Sacituzumab is a form of targeted therapy because it attaches to specific molecules on the surface of cancer cells, known as Trop-2 receptors, and delivers govitecan to kill them. Giving sacituzumab govitecan may shrink the cancer in the brain and/or extend the time until the cancer gets worse.",

        "DESCRIPTION": "Breast conservation therapy for early stage breast cancer has been an important achievement of oncology practice in the last half century and breast radiotherapy (RT) has been essential in its development. Several seminal randomized clinical trials conducted in the 1980's era demonstrated that breast radiotherapy following lumpectomy yielded overall survival outcomes equivalent to mastectomy for treatment of early stage invasive breast cancer leading to the National Institute of Health (NIH) Consensus Conference statement in 1991 supporting breast conservation treatment.This established lumpectomy with RT as an alternative to mastectomy and subsequently the rate of breast conservation for eligible breast cancer patients rose steadily. Shortly thereafter, investigators recognized that the toxicity, patient burden, and geographic barriers associated with the protracted treatment course for breast RT was a potential barrier to breast conservation utilization. Numerous phase III clinical trials were conducted randomizing women post lumpectomy to RT vs. observation aimed at identifying which cases did not derive a significant RT benefit. No such subsets of breast cancer patients were consistently identified, thereby solidifying the standard that breast conservation required both lumpectomy and RT. Two meta-analyses by the Early Breast Cancer Trialists Collaborative Group (EBCTCG) in 2005 and 2011 further reinforced the value of breast RT post lumpectomy by examining the relationship of local recurrence and breast cancer mortality relative to the use of breast RT post lumpectomy. In each analysis, it found for axillary node negative breast cancer patients undergoing breast conservation a small but consistent increase in breast cancer mortality when breast radiotherapy was omitted. As a result, breast RT after lumpectomy has become an established paradigm for breast conservation for early stage breast cancer and is recommended by the NCCN 2018 guidelines (as it has for nearly two decades) that are commonly used today by clinicians and health systems alike. The landscape of early stage breast cancer has changed dramatically over the past three decades since the establishment of breast conservation. Widespread screening with mammography has led to the diagnosis of smaller and earlier stage disease. All breast cancers are now routinely characterized by their hormone sensitivity based on the presence of estrogen and progesterone receptors on tumor cells within the biopsy or surgical specimen and presence of HER2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2) which has provided an additional means of stratifying breast cancer into distinct prognostic groups. Small, node negative invasive breast cancer that is hormone sensitive (HS) and HER2-negative has a lower overall recurrence rate (local, regional, and distant) than breast cancers characterized by more adverse clinical pathologic features. However, other than in a smaller subset of women greater than 70 years old, clinical trials in this HS population still demonstrated unacceptable local recurrence risks long term after lumpectomy alone emphasizing that clinical and pathologic features are insufficient for consistently identifying when RT can safely be omitted.",

To demonstrate that anti-PD-1 therapy in combination with carboplatin/weekly paclitaxel results in improved overall survival (OS) versus systemic chemotherapy alone.\n\nII. To demonstrate that anti-PD-1 therapy in combination with carboplatin/weekly paclitaxel results in improved objective response using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version (v)1.1 versus systemic chemotherapy alone.\n\nIII. To evaluate toxicity profiles of the two regimens.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms. Randomization will be 2:1 favoring the experimental regimen, Arm B.\n\nARM A: Patients receive paclitaxel intravenously (IV) on days 1, 8, and 15 of each cycle, and carboplatin IV on day 1 of each cycle.

        "SUMMARY": "This phase 3 trial compares the addition of nivolumab to chemotherapy (carboplatin and paclitaxel) versus usual treatment (chemotherapy alone) for the treatment of anal cancer that has spread to other places in the body (metastatic). Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Chemotherapy drugs, such as carboplatin and paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving nivolumab together with carboplatin and paclitaxel may help doctors find out if the treatment is better or the same as the usual approach.",

        "DESCRIPTION": "Rationale:\n\nStandard treatment of early stage vulvar cancer is a wide local excision of the primary tumor combined with the sentinel node (SN) procedure for the groins. An inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy (IFL) is only indicated in case of a positive SN. An IFL is associated with major morbidity, e.g. wound healing problems, lymphoceles, lymphedema of the legs and recurrent infections. GROINSS-V II investigated whether radiotherapy would be a safe alternative for IFL in case of SN metastasis. The results for radiotherapy in the group with metastasis \u2264 2mm are promising. This study also showed that for metastasis \\> 2mm, only radiotherapy was not efficient. The efficacy of treatment can be increased by adding chemotherapy or giving a higher dose of radiotherapy. GROINSS-V III will investigate this regimen.\n\nObjective:\n\nThe primary objective of this study is to investigate the safety of replacing inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy by chemoradiation in early stage vulvar cancer patients with a macrometastasis (\\>2mm) and/or extracapsular extension in the SN. The secondary objective is to evaluate the short and long-term morbidity associated with the SN procedure and chemoradiation.\n\nStudy design: Phase II treatment trial, with stopping rules for the incidence of groin recurrences.\n\nStudy population: early-stage vulvar cancer patients with a metastasis \\> 2mm in their SN, or more than one metastasis \u2264 2mm.\n\nIntervention: Participants will be treated with chemoradiation, in a total dose of 56Gy to the involved site, combined with weekly cisplatin 40mg/m2\n\nMain study parameters/endpoints: The primary endpoint is the groin recurrence rate in the first 2 years after primary treatment.\n\nNature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group relatedness: participants will be treated with chemoradiation during 5 weeks instead of surgical treatment. There is a risk that this treatment will not be as effective as surgical treatment, which may lead to more groin recurrences which are hard to treat. By continuously monitoring the groin recurrence rate the investigators will notice activation of the stopping rule as early as possible.",

        "SUMMARY": "This phase III trial compares the effects of nivolumab with chemo-immunotherapy versus chemo-immunotherapy alone in treating patients with newly diagnosed primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL). Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Treatment for PMBCL involves chemotherapy combined with an immunotherapy called rituximab. Chemotherapy drugs work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody. It binds to a protein called CD20, which is found on B cells (a type of white blood cell) and some types of cancer cells. This may help the immune system kill cancer cells. Giving nivolumab with chemo-immunotherapy may help treat patients with PMBCL.",

        "SUMMARY": "This phase III trial compares less intense hormone therapy and radiation therapy to usual hormone therapy and radiation therapy in treating patients with high risk prostate cancer and low gene risk score. This trial also compares more intense hormone therapy and radiation therapy to usual hormone therapy and radiation therapy in patients with high risk prostate cancer and high gene risk score. Apalutamide may help fight prostate cancer by blocking the use of androgen by the tumor cells. Radiation therapy uses high energy rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Giving a shorter hormone therapy treatment may work the same at controlling prostate cancer compared to the usual 24 month hormone therapy treatment in patients with low gene risk score. Adding apalutamide to the usual treatment may increase the length of time without prostate cancer spreading as compared to the usual treatment in patients with high gene risk score.",

        "SUMMARY": "People with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are usually treated with chemotherapy. Some people with AML have a changed FLT3 gene which causes leukemia cells to grow faster. Therefore, chemotherapy is less suitable to treat AML in people with the changed FLT3 gene.\n\nGilteritinib, given with venetoclax and azacitidine, is a potential new treatment for people with AML with the changed FLT3 gene. They cannot have chemotherapy due to old age or other conditions. Before these combined 3 medicines are available as a treatment, the researchers need to understand how they are processed by and act upon the body when given together. In this study, they do this to find a suitable dose for venetoclax and to check for potential medical problems from the treatment.\n\nIn this study, people newly diagnosed with AML who have the changed FLT3 gene and cannot have chemotherapy can take part.\n\nThe main aims of this study are: to find suitable doses of gilteritinib, venetoclax and azacitidine as a combined treatment; to learn how they are processed by and act upon the body; to learn the remission rate; to check for medical problems during this treatment.\n\nIn the study, people will visit the study clinic many times. The first visit is to check if they can take part. People will be asked about their medical history, have a medical examination, and have their vital signs checked. Also, they will have an ECG to check their heart rhythm and have some blood and urine samples taken for laboratory tests. They will have a chest X-ray and a bone marrow sample will be taken. The changed FLT3 gene will be confirmed, either by the bone marrow or a blood sample.\n\nThis study will be in 2 phases.\n\nIn Phase 1, different small groups of people will take venetoclax tablets containing lower to higher doses in the combined treatment. The doses of gilteritinib and azacytidine will be unchanged. This is done to find a suitable dose of venetoclax to use in phase 2 of the study. People will take tablets of gilteritinib and venetoclax once a day on a 28-day cycle. They will be given azacytidine as an infusion or an injection just under the skin. This will be for 7 days at the beginning of each 28-day cycle. They will continue cycles of treatment throughout this phase of the study.\n\nIn Phase 2, more people newly diagnosed with AML with the changed FLT3 gene will take part. They will be treated with the suitable doses of the combined treatment worked out from Phase 1. Treatment will be on a 28-day cycle. People will continue on cycles of treatment throughout this phase of the study.\n\nResearchers will work out the remission rate from this phase of the study. In each phase of the study, people can continue with up to 12 cycles of treatment if they can manage any medical problems. People will visit the study clinic many times during their first treatment cycle, and less often during the next cycles. During these visits, medical problems will be recorded and some blood samples will be taken for laboratory tests. On some visits, people will also have their vital signs checked. Bone marrow samples will be taken during cycle 1, and at the beginning of cycle 3. More samples will be taken during the study from people who are not in remission.\n\nWhen people have finished treatment, those who have responded well to treatment and are in remission will be invited to continue with up to 24 more cycles of gilteritinib plus azacitidine.\n\nAll people taking part in the study will visit the study clinic for an end-of-treatment visit. During this visit, medical problems will be recorded and some blood samples will be taken for laboratory tests. People will have a medical examination, an ECG, and will have their vital signs checked. Also, a bone marrow sample will be taken. There will be a follow-up visit 30 days later to check for medical problems. Then people will visit the clinic or get a phone call every 3 months for up to 3 years. This is to give an update on their current treatment for AML.\n\nSome people can have a stem cell transplant during the study if they meet certain study rules. They will pause their study treatment during the stem cell transplant process and continue study treatment afterwards.",

        "SUMMARY": "This phase II trial studies whether adding pembrolizumab to olaparib (standard of care) works better than olaparib alone in treating patients with pancreatic cancer with germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations that has spread to other places in the body (metastatic). BRCA1 and BRCA2 are human genes that produce tumor suppressor proteins. These proteins help repair damaged deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and, therefore, play a role in ensuring the stability of each cell's genetic material. When either of these genes is mutated, or altered, such that its protein product is not made or does not function correctly, DNA damage may not be repaired properly. As a result, cells are more likely to develop additional genetic alterations that can lead to some types of cancer, including pancreatic cancer. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Olaparib is an inhibitor of PARP, a protein that helps repair damaged DNA. Blocking PARP may help keep tumor cells from repairing their damaged DNA, causing them to die. PARP inhibitors are a type of targeted therapy. The addition of pembrolizumab to the usual treatment of olaparib may help to shrink tumors in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations.",

        "DESCRIPTION": "OVERVIEW: This is a Phase 1, multi-center, open-label, dose-escalation study of TAB004, a recombinant humanized IgG4\u03ba monoclonal antibody specific to BTLA when administered alone and in combination with toripalimab, a human IgG4k monocloncal antibody that specifically binds to the programmed death 1 (PD-1). It is estimated that up to 499 subjects with selected advanced solid malignancies (i.e.; non-small cell lung cancer \\[NSCLC\\], melanoma, renal cell carcinoma (RCC), urothelial carcinoma (UC), or other tumors), including lymphoma will be enrolled in the study.\n\nSubjects must have a histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced unresectable or metastatic solid tumor, including lymphoma.\n\nThe study has 4 parts; Part A dose-escalation, Part B cohort expansion, Part C dose-escalation and Part D cohort expansion. In Part A, up to 24 subjects will be enrolled who must have received, or be ineligible for, or intolerant of, all available approved or standard therapies know to confer clinical benefit including immunotherapy, or for whom no standard therapy exists.\n\nIn Part B, C and D, subjects must have received at least one line of therapy for advanced or metastatic disease, but are not required to have received all standard therapies known to confer clinical benefit.\n\nPart A is the monotherapy dose-escalation portion of the study. Four TAB004 dose levels are planned and include: 0.3, 1, 3 and 10 mg/kg. Part A will be the traditional 3 + 3 design with 3 to 6 subjects per dose level (cohort) and will receive their assigned dose every 21 days in the absence of a dose limiting toxicity (DLT) that would prevent further dosing.\n\nPart B is the monotherapy cohort expansion portion of the study and will consist of up to 50 subjects in each advanced solid tumor indication (up to 200 subjects) that may include but not be limited to lymphoma, melanoma, NSCLC, or other tumors with agreement of the Sponsor.\n\nPart C is the combination therapy dose-escalation portion of the study. Four dose levels are planned as follows: Cohort 1 - TAB004 20 mg and toripalimab 240mg; Cohort 2 - TAB004 70 mg and toripalimab 240 mg; Cohort 3 -TAB004 200 mg and toripalimab 240 mg; Cohort 4- TAB004 500 mg and toripalimab 240 mg. Part C will be the traditional 3 + 3 design with 3 to 6 subjects per dose level (cohort) and will receive their assigned doses every 21 days in the absence of a DLT that would prevent further dosing.\n\nPart D is the combination therapy cohort expansion portion of the study. Up to 50 subjects will be enrolled in each advanced solid tumor indication (melanoma, NSCLC, RCC, UC, lymphoma) (up to 250 subjects). Doses of TAB004 and toripalimab will be determined based upon safety and efficacy data from Part C.\n\nTumor response will be evaluated using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1), the immune-related Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (irRECIST), or the New Response Evaluation Criteria in Lymphoma (RECIL) 2017.\n\nIn the absence of confirmed disease progression and intolerable toxicities, subjects will be allowed to continue TAB004 (Part A and B) or TAB004 and toripalimab (Part C and D) administration every 21 days for up to 2 years.\n\nDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION TAB004 doses are 0.3, 1, 3, 10 mg/kg, 20mg, 70mg, 200mg and 500mg. Toripalimab dose is 240mg. TAB004 alone or TAB004 plus toripalimab will be administered as a 60-minute i.v. infusion for the first dose and may be decreased at the investigators discretion to 30 minutes in subsequent infusions.\n\nSAFETY EVALUATIONS Assessment of safety will be determined by vital sign measurements, clinical laboratory tests, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status evaluations, diagnostic imaging, physical examinations, electrocardiograms, and the incidence and severity of adverse events.\n\nSafety will also include evaluations of immune safety and immunogenicity. Blockade of BTLA pathway and PD-1 pathway by monoclonal antibodies has been demonstrated in several syngeneic mouse models to enhance specific T cell responses and inhibit tumor growth. In studies of BTLA deficient mice, diseases such as asthma, autoimmune involvement of the central nervous system, and systemic lupus erythematosus were exacerbated. Particular attention will be given to symptoms related to those diseases. The occurrence of adverse events that may follow enhanced T-cell activation such as pneumonitis, colitis, nephritis, severe skin reactions, endocrinopathies, or other immune-related adverse events (irAEs) will be evaluated for subjects receiving TAB004 alone or in combination with toripalimab.\n\nAn irAE is a clinically significant adverse event of any organ that is associated with drug exposure, of unknown etiology, and is consistent with an immune-mediated mechanism.\n\nEFFICACY EVALUATIONS will include best overall response, objective response rate, duration of response or duration of stable disease, progression free survival and overall response.\n\nPHARMACOKINETIC EVALUATIONS Pharmacokinetic parameters include AUC0-inf, AUC0-last, AUC0-21d, Cmax, Cmin trough, Tmax, t1/2, CL, accumulation and Vss.\n\nSTATISTICAL METHODS Part A and Part C are based on the 3+3 design for dose escalation and safety evaluation requirements. In Part B and Part D, sample size is estimated using Simon's two-phase design minimax method.\n\nAll PK/Pharmacodynamic, immunogenicity, and safety data will be summarized and presented by cohort as well as overall for the study, using descriptive statistics (number of subjects, mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum) for continuous variables and using frequencies and percentages for discrete variables.\n\nORR and the associated 2-sided 95% exact confidence limits will be calculated. The proportion of subjects who have experienced best response as CR, PR, SD, or progressive disease (PD) will be provided by cohorts in Part B and Part D.",
        "SUMMARY": "The primary objective is to assess the safety and tolerability of TAB004 as monotherapy and in combination with toripalimab in subjects with selected advanced solid malignancies, including lymphoma, and to evaluate the recommended Phase 2 dose.\n\nThe secondary objectives are to: 1) describe the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of TAB004 monotherapy and in combination with toripalimab and to describe the PK profile of toripalimab when administered with TAB004, 2) evaluate antitumor activity of TAB004 monotherapy and in combination with toripalimab; and 3) determine the immunogenicity of TAB004 monotherapy and in combination with toripalimab and to determine the immunogenicity of toripalimab when administered with TAB004.\n\nThe exploratory objectives are to: 1) evaluate pharmacodynamic effects of TAB004 on its target receptor BTLA, as well as effects on the immune system; 2) evaluate biomarkers that may correlate with activity of TAB004 as monotherapy and in combination with toripalimab; 3) evaluate the utility of BTLA ligand, herpesvirus-entry mediator (HVEM), and additional exploratory biomarkers that could aid in selection of appropriate subjects for TAB004 monotherapy and in combination with toripalimab.",

        "DESCRIPTION": "BXQ-350 is a novel anti-neoplastic therapeutic agent configured from two components: Saposin C (SapC), an expressed (human) lysosomal protein, and the phospholipid dioleoylphosphatidyl-serine (DOPS), a cell membrane phospholipid (clinical formulation BXQ-350).Due to the presumed mechanism of action of BXQ-350, Bexion anticipates that it may have an impact on ceramides, sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), and inflammatory cytokine levels. In addition, pre-clinical results demonstrated that BXQ-350 induced neurite generation and protection in vitro in the PC-12 and NS20Y cell lines and significantly decreased oxaliplatin-induced cold allodynia in a model of CIPN. Thus BXQ-350 may represent a new approach to deliver a neuropathy benefit.\n\nThe unique combination of BXQ-350 along with its proven safety profile, potential efficacy, and possible neuropathy benefit makes BXQ-350 a worthwhile candidate to use in combination with standard of care treatment for mCRC to not only enhance the standard treatment of mCRC, but also to evaluate its ability to alleviate side effects related to oxaliplatin-induced sensory neurotoxicity.",

        "DESCRIPTION": "Currently, there are no biomarkers validated prospectively in randomized studies for resected colon cancer to determine need for adjuvant chemotherapy. However, circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) shed into the bloodstream represents a highly specific and sensitive approach (especially with serial monitoring) for identifying microscopic or residual tumor cells in colon cancer patients and may outperform traditional clinical and pathological features in prognosticating risk for recurrence. Colon cancer patients who do not have detectable ctDNA (ctDNA-) are at a much lower risk of recurrence and may not need adjuvant chemotherapy. Furthermore, for colon cancer pts with detectable ctDNA (ctDNA+) who are at a very high risk of recurrence, the optimal adjuvant chemotherapy regimen has not been established. We hypothesize that for pts whose colon cancer has been resected, ctDNA status may be used to risk stratify for making decisions about adjuvant chemotherapy.",

        "DESCRIPTION": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To determine the difference in overall survival (OS) for patients given neoadjuvant gemcitabine hydrochloride (gemcitabine) and cisplatin prior to re-resection followed by adjuvant gemcitabine and cisplatin compared to patients who receive only adjuvant gemcitabine and cisplatin after re-resection for incidental gallbladder cancer (IGBC).\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To compare the incidence of residual disease at the time of re-resection between patients with IGBC who receive perioperative chemotherapy prior to re-resection and those who receive only adjuvant chemotherapy after re-resection.\n\nII. To assess the clinical effect of preoperative chemotherapy compared to upfront re-resection on resectability among 3 cohorts: all enrolled patients, all patients who undergo staging laparoscopy, and all patients who undergo laparotomy.\n\nIII. To determine the difference in progression-free survival (PFS) for patients with IGBC who receive perioperative chemotherapy prior to and after re-resection compared to patients who receive only adjuvant chemotherapy after re-resection.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.\n\nARM I: Within 4 weeks of randomization, patients undergo surgery to remove part of the liver, the lymph nodes around the liver, and possibly the bile ducts. Patients then receive gemcitabine intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes and cisplatin IV over 30 minutes-24 hours on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 8 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nARM II: Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes and cisplatin over 30 minutes-24 hours on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 4 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Approximately 4-8 weeks after completion of chemotherapy, patients whose disease has not spread to other places in the body (metastasized) undergo surgery as in Arm I. Patients with successful surgery then resume treatment with gemcitabine IV and cisplatin IV on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 4 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years, then every 6 months for 1 year after surgery or until disease recurrence, whichever comes first, for up to 5 years.",
        "SUMMARY": "This phase II/III trial compares the effect of adding chemotherapy before and after surgery versus after surgery alone (usual treatment) in treating patients with stage II-III gallbladder cancer. Chemotherapy drugs, such as gemcitabine and cisplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving chemotherapy before surgery may make the tumor smaller; therefore, may reduce the extent of surgery. Additionally, it may make it easier for the surgeon to distinguish between normal and cancerous tissue. Giving chemotherapy after surgery may kill any remaining tumor cells. This study will determine whether giving chemotherapy before surgery increases the length of time before the cancer may return and whether it will increase a patient's life span compared to the usual approach.",

This study is to test the hypothesis that the combination of Olvi-Vec followed by further chemotherapy is particularly effective against established tumors by virus-mediated immune activation and re-sensitization of tumor cells to chemotherapy. Participant population includes histologically confirmed non-resectable platinum-resistant/refractory ovarian cancer (PRROC). Determination of progression-free survival, safety and overall survival are key objectives. Participants randomized into the Experimental Arm will receive a single-cycle (2 infusions on two consecutive days) of Olvi-Vec through an intraperitoneal catheter. The catheter is then removed, and patients receive systemically administered platinum-doublet chemotherapy and bevacizumab. The control arm receives the same platinum-doublet chemotherapy and bevacizumab at the same dose and schedule. Biological samples will be obtained from some Experimental Arm participants for virus-shedding testing. Assessment of response to treatment in both arms will be by RECIST 1.1 and iRECIST. Maintenance/continued treatment with non-platinum chemotherapy and bevacizumab is dependent on a participant being clinically stable until confirmed progressive disease by iRECIST or can no longer tolerate therapy.\n\nDr. Robert W.

Must have a primary melanoma that is cutaneous (including head, neck, trunk, extremity, scalp, palm or sole).\n3. An uninterrupted 2cm margin must be technically feasible around biopsy scar or primary melanoma.\n4. Surgery (which refers to the staging sentinel node biopsy and wide local excision as these are both to be done on the same day) must be completed within 120 days of the original diagnosis.\n5. Patients must be 18 years or older at time of consent.\n6. Patient must be able to give informed consent and comply with the treatment protocol and follow-up plan.\n7. Life expectancy of at least 5 years from the time of diagnosis, not considering the melanoma in question, as determined by the PI.\n8. Patients must have an ECOG performance score between 0 and 1.\n9. A survivor of prior cancer is eligible provided that ALL of the following criteria are met and documented:\n\n   * The patient has undergone potentially curative therapy for all prior malignancies,\n   * There has been no evidence of recurrence of any prior malignancies for at least FIVE years (except for successfully treated cervical or non-melanoma skin cancer with no evidence of recurrence), and\n   * The patient is deemed by their treating physician to be at low risk of recurrence from previous malignancies.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nPatients will be excluded from the study for ANY of the following reasons:\n\n1. Uncertain diagnosis of melanoma i.e. so-called 'melanocytic lesion of unknown malignant potential'.\n2. Patient has already undergone wide local excision at the site of the primary index lesion.\n3. Patient unable or ineligible to undergo staging sentinel lymph node biopsy of the primary index lesion.\n4. Desmoplastic or neurotropic melanoma: with any patient where pathology determines melanoma as PURE desmoplastic (as per WHO definition of \\>90% desmoplasia), they are not eligible for this study. However other desmoplasia or mixed subtypes are eligible unless there is neurotropism present (peri-neural invasion).Peri-neural invasion does not include entrapment of nerves within the main primary tumour mass. Microsatellitosis as per AJCC 8th edition definition\n5. Subungual melanoma\n6. Patient has already undergone a local flap reconstruction of the defect after excision of the primary and determination of an accurate excision margin is impossible.\n7. History of previous or concurrent (i.e., second primary) invasive melanoma.\n8. Melanoma located distal to the metacarpophalangeal joint; on the tip of the nose; the eyelids or on the ear; genitalia, perineum or anus; mucous membranes or internal viscera.\n9. Physical, clinical, radiographic or pathologic evidence of satellite, in-transit, regional, or distant metastatic melanoma.\n10. Patient has undergone surgery on a separate occasion to clear the lymph nodes of the probable draining lymphatic field, including sentinel lymph node biopsy, of the index melanoma.\n11. Any additional solid tumour or hematologic malignancy during the past 5 years except T1 skin lesions of squamous cell carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma, or uterine/cervical cancer.\n12. Melanoma-related operative procedures not corresponding to criteria described in the protocol.\n13. Planned adjuvant radiotherapy to the primary melanoma site after Wide Local Excision is not permitted as part of the protocol and any patients given this treatment would be excluded from the study.\n14. History of organ transplantation.\n15. Oral or parenteral immunosuppressive agents (not topical or inhaled steroids) at enrolment or within 6 months prior to enrolment.\n\nPregnancy is not a specific exclusion criterion for this trial, though it may not be clinically appropriate to perform a wide excision and sentinel node biopsy until the pregnancy has been completed, which is likely to exclude the patient due to violation of inclusion criterion 4. We would advise careful counselling of the patient prior to enrolling the patient, which would include a discussion at the treating centre's multidisciplinary team meeting or tumour board. We would strongly advise contacting the central trial office to discuss the case prior to enrolling on the study.",

The study is designed to be able to prove or disprove that there is no difference in risk of the tumour recurring around the scar or anywhere else in the body between the two groups of patients. If the study shows no risk of tumour recurrence then we will also be able to determine how much of an impact the narrower excision has on patients in terms of improved quality of life and reduced side effects from the surgery and melanoma disease. This trial will also evaluate and determine the economic impact of narrower excision margins on the health services and society in general.",

        "SUMMARY": "This phase II trial tests whether adding nivolumab to the usual treatment (encorafenib and cetuximab) works better than the usual treatment alone to shrink tumors in patients with colorectal cancer that has spread to other places in the body (metastatic) or that cannot be removed by surgery (unresectable) and whose tumor has a mutation in a gene called BRAF. Encorafenib is in a class of medications called kinase inhibitors. It is used in patients whose cancer has a certain mutation (change) in the BRAF gene. It works by blocking the action of mutated BRAF that signals cancer cells to multiply. This helps to stop or slow the spread of cancer cells. Cetuximab is in a class of medications called monoclonal antibodies. It binds to a protein called EGFR, which is found on some types of cancer cells. This may help keep cancer cells from growing. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving nivolumab in combination with encorafenib and cetuximab may be more effective than encorafenib and cetuximab alone at stopping tumor growth and spreading in patients with metastatic or unresectable BRAF-mutant colorectal cancer.",

        "DESCRIPTION": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To determine if the regimen with the two alkylating agents temozolomide and lomustine with radiotherapy (RT) significantly prolongs overall survival (OS) versus (vs.) standard chemoradiotherapy with temozolomide in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma (GBM) with MGMT promoter methylation.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine if the regimen with the two alkylating agents temozolomide and lomustine with radiotherapy (RT) significantly prolongs progression-free survival (PFS) vs. standard chemoradiotherapy with temozolomide in patients with newly diagnosed GBM with MGMT promoter methylation.\n\nII. To compare the two different chemotherapy regimens on patient-reported outcomes (PROs), as measured by the MD Anderson Symptom Inventory - Brain Tumor (MDASI-BT) in patients with newly diagnosed GBM with MGMT promoter methylation.\n\nIII. To determine if the regimen with the two alkylating agents temozolomide and lomustine with radiotherapy (RT) is associated with inferior short-term change in patient reported outcomes (PROs) as measured by MDASI-BT vs. standard chemoradiotherapy with temozolomide in patients with newly diagnosed GBM with MGMT promoter methylation.\n\nIV. To assess toxicity in the two different chemotherapy regimens.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To assess the association between absolute lymphocyte counts and outcomes. II. To assess the association between CD4+ lymphocyte counts and outcomes. III. To compare the two different chemotherapy regimens in terms of long-term PROs as measured by MDASI-BT at years 1 and 2.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.\n\nARM I: Patients undergo radiation therapy 5 days per week and receive temozolomide orally (PO) once daily (QD) for 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then receive temozolomide PO QD on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 6 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nARM II: Patients undergo radiation therapy 5 days per week for 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also receive lomustine PO on day 1 and temozolomide PO QD on days 2-6. Treatment repeats every 42 days for 6 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for year 1, every 4 months for year 2, and then every 6 months thereafter.",
        "SUMMARY": "This phase III trial compares the effect of adding lomustine to temozolomide and radiation therapy versus temozolomide and radiation therapy alone in shrinking or stabilizing newly diagnosed MGMT methylated glioblastoma. Chemotherapy drugs, such as lomustine and temozolomide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Radiation therapy uses high energy photons to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Adding lomustine to usual treatment of temozolomide and radiation therapy may help shrink and stabilize glioblastoma.",

To minimize time-to-treatment, the study will use emergency research informed consent procedures (including exception from informed consent (EFIC) in the United States) and mobile stroke units (MSUs), with a goal of \u00bd of participants treated within 90 minutes, as accomplished in the NINDS t-PA trials. The FASTEST Trial will include approximately 100 hospital sites and at least 15 MSUs in the NINDS-funded StrokeNet and key global institutions with large volumes of ICH patients and the ability to treat them within 120 minutes of stroke onset. Recruitment of 860 participants over 3\u00bd years is planned.

        "DESCRIPTION": "This home-based randomized clinical trial is designed to test the efficacy of ZA-5 mg in Parkinson's disease (PD) and parkinsonism patients. This trial will also address barriers to treatment of patients with PD and parkinsonism by providing rigorous evidence about whether ZA reduces fracture risk in patients with PD and parkinsonism, simplifying treatment by giving ZA at home without extra medical visits and BMD testing, and overcoming poor persistence with oral therapies because one infusion may prevent bone loss for at least 2 years. The outcome of this trial will demonstrate how a home-based fracture prevention can reach older PD patients who would not otherwise receive treatment to reduce their high risk of fractures.\n\nPatients with PD will be recruited throughout the US by participating neurologists and health networks as well as the Parkinson's Foundation. Patients may also self-refer to the study. Interested patients can access study information on a study website (topaz.eurekaplatform.org) as well as through the Parkinson's Foundation Helpline. Patients who wish to enroll will be directed to an interactive electronic consent (eConsent). Following eConsent, participants complete a screening questionnaire (to confirm eligibility), followed by a baseline questionnaire. If a participant is determined to be eligible following these steps, they may be scheduled for a Telemedicine assessment to further confirm the PD or parkinsonism diagnosis, unless they have been referred directly from a participating neurologist. If confirmed, the participant will be mailed a supply of vitamin D3 800-1000 IU and instructed to take one vitamin D tablet every day for 2 months. Lastly, a Nurse Home Visit will be scheduled and conducted to confirm final eligibility, randomization, and administration of the study drug, if appropriate. Participants who are randomized will be contacted every 4 months for at least 2 years to determine if they have had any fractures.",

        "DESCRIPTION": "This is a two phase multicenter study to assess the operating characteristics of the EsoGuard diagnostic assay panel performed on esophageal mucosal cells collected using the EsoCheck cell collection device in known \"Cases\" of disease (i.e., patients with a history of Barrett's Esophagus (BE) with and without varying degrees of dysplasia or intramucosal adenocarcinoma \\[IMC\\]) and in patients with no known history of these conditions. The latter are presumed to be \"Controls\", though this final determination is made as part of study conduct, not at the time of enrollment.\n\nThe study is divided into a Run-In phase and an Efficacy phase. The assignment of a patient to one or the other of these two phases will be made based on two pieces of information: 1) the Final Study Diagnosis (as defined below) and 2) the current tally versus the pre-determined target number of patients already assigned to each of the subgroups (e.g., non-dysplastic Barrett's Esophagus (NDBE), high grade dysplasia {HGD\\]) for each phase. Patients will first be enrolled into the Run-In phase subgroups. Only once the targeted enrollment for a given Run-In phase subgroup has been reached, subsequent patients with a particular diagnosis will be assigned to the appropriate Efficacy Phase subgroup, until the targeted total number is reached. Run In phase data will be maintained in a separate database from Efficacy phase data. Study conduct is identical in both phases; however, data from each phase will be segregated and analysis of each phase will be used solely for its predetermined purpose without any co-mingling of data. Once assigned, no patient, or their data, will be re-assigned or moved from being a Run-In phase patient to being an Efficacy phase patient, or from the Run-In phase database to the Efficacy phase database, or vice versa.\n\nThe Run-In phase will enroll the initial 60 short segment NDBE (also known as short segment Barrett's Esophagus \\[SSBE\\]) and 25 long segment NDBE (also known as long segment Barrett's Esophagus \\[LSBE\\]) Cases, the initial 10 low grade dysplasia \\[LGD\\] Cases, the initial 3 high grade dysplasia \\[HGD\\] Cases, and the initial 2 intramucosal adenocarcinoma \\[IMC\\] Cases, as well as the initial 100 Controls. The Efficacy phase will enroll 54 Cases each with a Final Study Diagnosis of NDBE, LGD, HGD, and IMC, and 54 Controls.\n\nRun-In phase data will be used solely to derive the optimal numerical cutoffs by which to score mVIM and mCCNA1 (which are two genes where the methylated DNA changes are located) positivity or negativity. These cutoffs serve as the key inputs into an algorithm by which an overall EsoGuard result of positive versus negative is determined. The setting of these cutoffs will be done by Sponsor personnel with full access to all Run-In phase data; the goal will be to optimize overall EsoGuard assay sensitivity and specificity for its intended use as a screening test in the at-risk population. The assay, once validated and locked, will be used to analyze patients' distal esophageal cells obtained in both the Efficacy phase of this Case Control study as well as in a separate Screening study (PR-1039/EG-CL-101) to be conducted in parallel. Only Run-In phase data will be used to set cutoffs. The mVIM and mCCNA1 (i.e., genes with methylated DNA changes) cutoffs will be set and then the EsoGuard assay re validated and \"locked\", all before any Efficacy phase distal esophageal cells specimens collected from study patients will undergo EsoGuard analysis.\n\nSponsor personnel will have open access to all Run-In phase data during the enrollment of the Run-In phase in order to determine if the data from patients enrolled to date is sufficient to inform adequately the setting of cutoffs. If Sponsor so determines, it may elect to terminate enrollment in the Run-In phase early (i.e., prior to enrolling the 100 Cases and 100 Controls listed above). If early termination of the Run-In phase is elected, all patients enrolled subsequent to the date Sponsor makes this election will be entered into the Efficacy phase and such subsequent patients will count towards the Efficacy phase enrollment objectives.\n\nAs well, should Sponsor complete the intended Run-In phase enrollment of 100 Cases and 100 Controls but determine, upon its assessment of the resulting data, that data from additional Cases could improve the setting of cutoffs, Sponsor may decide to enroll up to 100 additional Run-In phase Cases. These 100 Cases may be in whatever distribution of disease Sponsor elects (i.e., ranging from NDBE through to IMC). In order to augment the Run-In phase patient counts, the Sponsor will set updated targets for enrollment of each Run-In phase subgroup and will assign patients to each Run-In subgroup to be augmented, based on patients' Final Study Diagnosis and on whether the updated subgroup target has been met. When each updated subgroup enrollment target has once again been met, subsequent patients with that subgroup diagnosis will be enrolled into the Efficacy phase.",

Much attention is paid to the variability within individual mutations (e.g. distal presentations), as opposed to defining the best strategy for measuring change in overall LGMD disease burden. This presents a major dilemma for LGMD rare disease research: how to balance diverse genes leading to overlapping phenotypes, versus variants in the same gene leading to divergent phenotypes. What is clear, is as a group, LGMDs are chronic and progressive leading to significant lifetime morbidity and represent a large unmet clinical need.\n\nRecent developments in the investigator's genetic understanding of LGMD and molecular approaches to therapy have led to proposed gene replacement therapies for at least three of the LGMD mutations. Several of these gene replacement therapies are currently in pre-clinical/phase 1 testing, leading to an urgent need for natural history data. In addition, non-specific therapies which target muscle mass or function are being tested in other muscular dystrophies and may prove beneficial for LGMD.",

This trial is designed as a perpetual platform trial. This means that there is a single Master Protocol dictating the conduct of the trial.\n\nIn this trial, multiple investigational products for ALS will be tested simultaneously or sequentially. Each investigational product will be tested in a regimen. Each regimen consists of a placebo-controlled trial, meaning that the active investigational product and matching placebo will be tested in each regimen.\n\nThe additional details that govern the testing of each investigational product will be summarized in separate regimen-specific appendices (RSAs). Each regimen will have a separate ClinicalTrials.gov posting, which will include specific information about the regimen. All regimen-specific outcome measures will be detailed in each regimen posting.\n\nParticipants will have an equal chance to be randomized to all regimens that are active at the time of screening. Once randomized to a regimen, participants will be randomized in a 3:1 ratio to either study drug or placebo.\n\nThe following regimens are active in the trial:\n\nRegimen A - Zilucoplan Regimen B - Verdiperstat Regimen C - CNM-Au8 Regimen D - Priodopidine Regimen E - SLS-005 Trehalose Regimen F - ABBV-CLS-7262 Regimen G - DNL343\n\nNew regimens will be continuously added as new investigational products become available.

According to society guidelines, PCLs with specific features should prompt additional workup with endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) for cyst characterization as well as cyst sampling. This can help determine if the cyst is mucinous or non-mucinous which has implications for its malignant potential. Cyst fluid has traditionally been sampled using EUS with FNA (Fine-Needle Aspiration) and sent for fluid analysis (CEA and amylase) and cytology. However, despite use of a cyst fluid carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level cutoff of 192 ng/mL and cytology, accuracy of diagnosis for PCLs is poor. As the spectrum ranges from benign to high risk for neoplasm, precise diagnosis is critical. More recently, the adjunctive use of the Moray\u00ae through the needle micro forceps biopsy (EUS-MFB) has shown promise for diagnosis of PCLs. This technology utilizes a micro forceps through a 19-gauge needle to biopsy the cyst wall for histology, in addition to collecting cyst fluid for CEA level and cytology. Only a few small retrospective reports have been published regarding the use of MFB. Pancreatic cysts continue to pose a management dilemma for practicing clinicians, especially with the increased use of radiologic imaging modalities identifying incidental pancreatic cystic lesions with higher frequency. This leads to patient anxiety and increased costs due to radiologic surveillance and even surgery. The results of this study will hopefully help increase diagnostic yield by obtaining a histopathologic diagnosis of these PCLs, and potentially affect practice patterns of gastroenterologists and the endoscopic community, specifically those physicians who perform EUS in these patients. Furthermore, the results will help determine whether there is reason to continue this line of research to obtain a definite histologic tissue diagnosis of PCLs.",

To ensure diversity, the study will enroll at least 2,000 Blacks/African Americans, at least 2,000 Latinos/Hispanics, and up to 3,000 additional participants from other racial and ethnic backgrounds. Based on disease stage prior to PET, all participants will be classified as having MCI or dementia as their disease stage. Based on their clinical presentation prior to PET, all participants will be classified as having \"typical\" (i.e. progressive amnestic) or \"atypical\" clinical presentations of AD as the potential cause of dementia or MCI.\n\nDementia specialists will team with PET facilities that have trained radiologists/nuclear medicine physicians and access to perform amyloid PET. All participating physicians and study staff will complete comprehensive training to ensure adherence of data requirements and study timelines. Amyloid PET will be performed and interpreted at each facility with results provided to the ordering dementia specialist for support in further decision making. The dementia specialists will record their diagnosis and intended management plan based on the current clinical and diagnostic information, and assuming no future access to amyloid PET at the \"Pre-PET visit.\" This represents a \"thought experiment\" documenting the management plan that would be recommended by the specialist if the participant were not enrolling in New IDEAS and thus had no access to amyloid PET. PET results will be disclosed to patients and any consequent changes in management (if any) will be recommended at the \"PET disclosure visit.\" Patients will return 90 \u00b1 30 days following PET for an in person \"Post-PET visit.\" At this final visit, the dementia specialists will record the diagnosis and implemented management plan, incorporating amyloid PET into clinical decision making. Medicare claims data will be collected directly from CMS for 12 months prior to the PET imaging and 12 months after the PET imaging, for each participant.\n\nAim 1 utilizes Medicare claims data to compare 12-month claims-derived outcomes in amyloid PET-positive versus amyloid PET-negative individuals with MCI and dementia across the entire cohort. Aims 2 and 3 investigate these associations in sub-groups of study participants based on self-identified race and ethnicity (Aim 2) and clinical presentation (Aim 3). Aims 2 and 3 additionally evaluate changes in management between the pre- and post-PET visits in the relevant sub-groups, to test whether benefits in health outcomes are mediated by changes in clinical management. The investigator's over-arching hypothesis, supported by preliminary data from the first IDEAS study, is that amyloid PET results will be associated with changes in clinical management, which in turn will translate into improved health outcomes in patients with amyloid PET-positive scans in comparison with patients with amyloid PET-negative scans. We further hypothesize that these effects will be seen across patients of different ethnoracial backgrounds, clinical presentations and disease stages (MCI and dementia).\n\nOptional components of the study include the collection and archival of participant's amyloid PET images, and blood plasma. These repositories will serve as a resource to the field, enabling the testing and validation of emerging genetic and blood biomarkers. Separate consent will be obtained for participation in these components.",

        "DESCRIPTION": "This double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study will evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of three different dose levels of Auxora in patients with acute pancreatitis and accompanying SIRS.\n\nApproximately 216 patients will be randomized 1:1:1:1 into one of 4 groups using a computer generated randomization scheme accessed through an interactive voice/web response system (IXRS). Randomization will be first stratified by gender (male or female) and then by risk for organ failure in the gender subgroups (higher or lower). Higher risk for organ failure is defined by the presence of both an elevated hematocrit (HCT \u226544% for men or \u226540% for women) and hypoxemia (imputed PaO2/FiO2 \u2264360). Lower risk for organ failure is defined by the absence of either or both an elevated hematocrit and hypoxemia. The PaO2/FiO2 will be determined using an arterial blood gas or imputed using pulse oximetry.\n\nAll patients will have received a Screening CECT of the abdomen/pancreas before being randomized into the study. CECTs performed as standard of care may be used as the Screening CECT but must have been performed in the 24 hours before Consent or after Consent and before Randomization.\n\nThe Start of First Infusion of Study Drug (SFISD) should occur within 8 hours of the patient or LAR providing informed consent. Patients randomized to Group 1 will receive 2.0 mg/kg of Auxora intravenously every 24 hours (\u00b11 hour) for a total of three doses. Patients randomized to Group 2 will receive 1.0 mg/kg of Auxora intravenously every 24 hours (\u00b11 hour) for a total of three doses. Patients randomized to Group 3 will receive 0.5 mg/kg of Auxora intravenously every 24 hours (\u00b11 hour) for a total of three doses. Patients randomized to Group 4 will receive emulsion without any active pharmaceutical ingredient. Patients in Group 4 will receive one of three randomly assigned dose volumes, 1.25 mL/kg, 0.625 mL/kg, or 0.3125 mL/kg, which will be administered intravenously every 24 hours (\u00b11 hour) for a total of three doses. The dosing will be based on actual body weight obtained at the time of hospitalization or screening for the study. As described in the pharmacy manual, the upper limit of the volume of Auxora and volume of Placebo that will be administered will be 156.25 mL. The sponsor, investigators and patients will be blinded to the assigned group. In the event of a medical emergency, investigators will be able to receive the treatment assignment if required to provide optimal care of the patient.\n\nFor all 4 groups, a study physician or appropriately trained delegate will perform assessments at screening, at the baseline assessment, immediately prior to the SFISD, and then every 24 hours until 240 hours after the SFISD, or until discharge if earlier. If patients remain hospitalized at Day 12, assessments will then be performed every 48 hours starting on Day 12 until Day 28, or until discharge if earlier. Patients discharged from the hospital before Day 25 will return at Day 30 (+5 days) to perform the Day 30 assessments. If patients are discharged on Days 25-29, the Day 30 assessments may be performed prior to discharge.\n\nPatients will receive another CECT of the abdomen/pancreas at the Day 30 (\u00b15 days) visit. All CECTs performed as standard of care after randomization and before the Day 30 CECT will also be captured. A blinded central reader will read the Screening, Day 30, and any standard of care CECTs obtained between randomization and the Day 30 visit.\n\nPatients will complete the modified American Neurogastroenterology and Motility Society Gastrointestinal Cardinal Symptom Index Daily Diary (mGCSI-DD) worksheet at the baseline assessment, at 96 hours, 168hours, Day 14 and Day 21 (for patients who remain hospitalized on these days), on the day of discharge, and daily at bedtime after discharge until the Day 30 visit. Patients who are discharged on Days 25-29 will not complete the mGCSI worksheet after discharge.\n\nIt is recommended that all patients randomized in the study should receive care consistent with the 2018 American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) Institute Technical Review of the Initial Medical Management of Acute Pancreatitis. Patients should receive local standard of care (SOC) for the management of other medical conditions.\n\nIn patients with acute pancreatitis, the AGA strongly recommends early oral feeding (within 24 hours) rather than keeping the patient nil per mouth (Nil per Os, NPO). Patients randomized into the study, therefore, will be offered a low fat, \u2265500-calorie solid meal at each mealtime after the infusion of the first dose of study drug if alert and not on mechanical ventilation, or if not NPO for a planned surgey/medical procedure, or if not NPO because of an acute medical condition. If the patient does not wish to eat the solid meal when offered or is unable to tolerate the solid meal, they should then be offered a liquid meal. The same approach should occur at each subsequent mealtime. When patients eat a solid meal, it should be recorded if they ate \u226550% of the meal and if they either vomited or experienced an increase in abdominal pain in the two hours after eating a meal.\n\nIt is also recommended that all patients randomized in the study should not be discharged from the hospital until solid food is tolerated, abdominal pain has resolved or been adequately controlled, and there is no clinical evidence of infection. Tolerating solid food is defined as eating \u226550% of a low fat, \u2265500-calorie solid meal without an increase in abdominal pain or vomiting. If the patient is not tolerating either solid or liquid meals, tube feedings should be considered.\n\nAll protocol required laboratory testing, except biomarker and PK samples, will be performed at the local laboratory. Results from the biomarkers and PK blood samples collected as part of the protocol and being tested at a central lab will not be available to assist the PI or treating physician in managing the patient.",
        "SUMMARY": "Approximately 216 patients with acute pancreatitis and accompanying SIRS will be randomized at approximately 30 sites. Patients will be randomly assigned to either Auxora at one of three dose levels or one of three placebo volumes to maintain the double-blind. Study drug infusions will occur every 24 hours for three consecutive days for a total of three infusions. Patients will remain hospitalized as per standard of care and once discharged will be asked to complete a daily meal diary and return for a Day 30 safety assessment.

Data collected will be used to prospectively study the natural history of NMOSD, real-word effectiveness and safety of medications used to treat NMOSD, and drug utilization treatment patterns. Additionally, the data will be used to systematically evaluate the burden for patients with NMOSD and the impact of therapies on quality of life. This will be done through real time capture and adjudication of relapses, the standardized collection of patient-reported outcomes (PRO) and clinician-reported outcomes (ClinRO), the active evaluation of prevalent and incident comorbidities and adverse events, and the recording of medication utilization patterns.\n\nPersonal information is also collected from each consenting registry patient allowing for linkages to other public or private clinical and administrative databases, as well as to databases maintained by organizations focused on the care and treatment of NMOSD for the purposes of clinical, market, or outcomes research. This provides an opportunity to evaluate other aspects of the disease and its treatment including but not limited to clinical and drug cost-effectiveness, health care resource utilization, and patient adherence.\n\nConsent for additional ad hoc surveys will be solicited which can allow evaluation of additional aspects of the disease impact such as care giver burden or impact of disease on productivity.",

        "DESCRIPTION": "N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis is one of the most common causes of autoimmune encephalitis, with prevalence exceeding herpes encephalitis in industrialized nations. Typically, the disease affects patients age 10-50 causing prominent psychiatric symptoms, altered consciousness, seizures, movement disorders and life-threatening dysautonomia. Intensive care, including cardiorespiratory support is required in 75% of cases. The diagnosis is confirmed by detection of IgG autoantibodies against central nervous system NMDAR in the cerebrospinal fluid. Despite the severity of the illness, NMDAR encephalitis is a treatable neurological disease, with retrospective case series establishing the benefit of off-label intravenous steroids and immunoglobulins. These treatments are presumed to work through effects on IgG NMDAR autoantibody levels in the CSF, although prospective data informing predictors of treatment responses are limited. Even with prompt treatment, \\~50% of patients remain disabled, requiring prolonged hospital admissions. Various off-label therapies have been proposed as \"second-line\" treatments in NMDAR encephalitis. The majority of second-line treatments target circulating B-cells with various degrees of blood brain penetrance and efficacy, and poor consensus on the timing, dose and route of delivery of candidate agents. High-quality evidence is needed to inform the treatment of NMDAR encephalitis. Inebilizumab is a promising therapeutic monoclonal antibody for the treatment of NMDAR encephalitis. This humanized monoclonal antibody against the B-cell surface antigen CD19 was recently shown to be safe and efficacious in the treatment of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder-another antibody-mediated disorder of the central nervous system. Compared to other off label B-cell depleting therapies, such as rituximab, inebilizumab not only depletes CD20+ B-cells, but also CD20- plasmablasts and plasma cells, resulting in robust and sustained suppression of B-cell expression. The ExTINGUISH Trial will randomize 116 participants with moderate-to-severe NMDAR encephalitis to receive either inebilizumab or placebo in addition to first-line therapies. Patient outcomes will be ascertained at standard intervals using the modified Rankin scale and accepted safety measures (primary outcomes at 16 weeks), together with comprehensive validated neuropsychological tests, bedside cognitive screening tools, quality of life/ functional indices, and outcome prediction measures. Clinical data will be combined with quantitative measures of NMDAR autoantibody titers and cytokines implicated in B-cell activation and antibody production within the intrathecal compartment to identify treatment responders, inform the biologic contributors to outcomes, and evaluate for biomarkers that may serve as early predictors of favorable outcomes in future clinical trials in NMDAR encephalitis. The ExTINGUISH Trial will prospectively study an optimized B-cell depletion therapy to promote better long-term outcomes in NMDAR encephalitis, to determine more meaningful cognitive endpoints, and to identify better biologic biomarkers to predict outcome.",

        "DESCRIPTION": "IIM is considered as a group of rare diseases that is characterized by common features of insidious painless, proximal skeletal muscle weakness, low endurance, and elevated serum muscle enzyme levels. Due to muscle weakness and progressive muscular atrophy, decreasing endurance, internal organ involvement (mainly given the pulmonary, gastrointestinal and cardiac manifestations) and limited therapeutic options, IIM often leads to physical disability and decreased quality of life. Nipocalimab is a fully human aglycosylated immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibody (mAb) designed to selectively bind, saturate, and block the immunoglobulin G (IgG) binding site on the endogenous neonatal fragment crystallizable receptor (FcRn) that binds, salvages, and recycles IgG into circulation or transport IgG across the placenta, following nonspecific pinocytosis into endothelial cells and cells of the reticuloendothelial system. At homeostasis, FcRn recycles IgG to maintain serum IgG levels and extend IgG half-life and also regulates immune cell inflammatory responses to IgG complexes. By targeting the IgG binding site on FcRn, nipocalimab is expected to block the binding and, hence, recycling of IgG, resulting in a decrease in circulating IgG antibody levels, including pathogenic IgG autoantibodies and alloantibodies. Therefore, nipocalimab has potential in the treatment of active IIM by decreasing pathogenic IgG antibody concentrations. The total duration of the study is up to 112 weeks, consisting of 4 study periods: a less than or equal to (\\<=) 6-week screening period, a 52-week double-blind period, a 48-week long term extension (LTE), and a safety follow-up 8 weeks post last administration of study intervention. Safety assessments include adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), adverse events of special interest (AESIs), laboratory parameters (hematology and chemistry, including lipid panel), vital signs, and physical examination.",

        "DESCRIPTION": "Pneumonia is a leading cause of hospitalization among adults and children in the United States and has ranked among the top 10 causes of death according to the CDC. A large variety of microorganisms can cause pneumonia including respiratory viruses, bacteria and fungi and there are great geographic variations in their prevalence. In the United States, common causes of viral pneumonia are SARS-CoV-2, influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and bacterial pneumonia are Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus).\n\nEmerging evidence indicates that the respiratory system mechanics of patients with typical ARDS, with or without COVID-19 are broadly similar in contrast to earlier reports that suggested COVID-19-associated ARDS has distinctive features. SOC for patients with ARDS remains limited with current interventions that focus primarily on supportive therapy, including fluid management strategies and further injury prevention via lung protective ventilation. Ventilation approaches remain the cornerstone in the treatment of ARDS and approaches to minimize ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) resulting from the imposition of stretch-trauma to the lung, continue to be a major focus of clinical importance. Several techniques may be utilized to accomplish this objective. Clinical guidelines strongly recommend volume-limited or pressure-limited ventilator approaches for patients with severe ARDS and high positive-end expiratory pressure strategies for patients with moderate to severe ARDS. Despite decades of improving supportive care, mortality remains high, ranging from 34.9% of patients with mild ARDS to 46.1% of patients with severe ARDS.\n\nWhatever the causative organism it is increasingly apparent that their impact on lung microvasculature is a major contributing factor to morbidity and mortality associated with those infections. Most deaths from influenza virus infections occur due to pulmonary complications, in particular the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), that is due to increased permeability of the lung microvasculature. Emerging evidence in COVID-19 infections suggest a similar pathophysiology where pulmonary endothelial cells and vascular dysfunction contribute to the initiation and propagation of ARDS by altering blood vessel integrity, promoting a pro-coagulative state, inducing endotheliitis and mediating inflammatory cell infiltration. Therefore, a therapeutic intervention that could modulate the course of pulmonary disease not by treating the causative organism but by reducing the deleterious inflammatory sequalae of those infections may have a significant positive impact\n\nAV-001 is a synthetic Angiopoietin-1 (Angpt-1) mimetic that has been shown to activate the Tie2 receptor tyrosine kinase; a transmembrane protein target most highly expressed on the surface of endothelial cells in the vasculature. The Tie2/Angiopoietin signaling axis has been identified as a nonredundant gatekeeper of vascular homeostasis. In healthy individuals, Tie2 is highly activated and signals the endothelium to fortify intracellular junctions and reduce expression of adhesion molecules, which serve as leukocyte tethers upon inflammation. As such, homeostatic activation results in the promotion of barrier defense against vascular leakage.\n\nA total of 120 eligible patients (20 patients each in cohorts 1, 2 and 3 and 60 patients in cohort 4) will be recruited from participating institutions / hospitals. Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either AV-001 Injection or AV-001 placebo Injection, together with SOC. All patients will receive supportive care according to the SOC for the trial site hospital likely to include remdesivir and or dexamethasone. Study drug will be administered by bolus IV injection (\\< 60 seconds). Doses of AV-001 Injection to be administered will start with the lowest proposed dose of 12.5 \u03bcg/kg/day in cohort 1 (DL1) and are anticipated to increase to 25 \u03bcg/kg/day in cohort 2 (DL2), 56 \u03bcg/kg/day in cohort 3 (DL3) and to be determined (TBD) based on recommendation from the DSMB for cohort 4 (DL4). The dose for cohort 4 will be chosen based on available safety and efficacy data obtained from all patients completing DL1, DL2 and DL3. DL4 may be an intermediate dose level, repeat of an earlier dose level (DL1, DL2, or DL3) or expansion of earlier dose level cohort (DL1, DL2, or DL3). Based on emerging data, a decision to enroll a fifth cohort (n=20 to increase the sample size to n=140) may also be made for the purpose of investigating an intermediate dose level, evaluating effects in patients with a different baseline Clinical Progression Scale (CPS) score or to provide comparative data regarding AV-001 Injection in patients with other respiratory viruses.\n\nThe study population for this Phase 2a study will consist of male and non-pregnant female patients, \u2265 18 years of age, hospitalized with presumed pneumonia secondary to SARS-CoV-2 or other viral or bacterial infection with acute onset to a respiratory compromise requiring supplemental oxygen therapy.",

        "SUMMARY": "Researchers are looking for a better way to prevent an ischemic stroke which occurs when a blood clot travelled to the brain in people who within the last 72 hours had:\n\n* an acute stroke due to a blood clot that formed outside the heart (acute non-cardioembolic ischemic stroke), or\n* TIA/mini-stroke with a high risk of turning into a stroke (high-risk transient ischemic attack), and who are planned to receive standard of care therapy. Acute ischemic strokes or TIA/mini-stroke result from a blocked or reduced blood flow to a part of the brain. They are caused by blood clots that travel to the brain and block the vessels that supply it. If these blood clots form elsewhere than in the heart, the stroke is called non-cardioembolic. People who already had a non-cardioembolic stroke are more likely to have another stroke. This is why they are treated preventively with an antiplatelet therapy, the current standard of care. Antiplatelet medicines prevent platelets, components of blood clotting, from clumping together.\n\nAnticoagulants are another type of medicine that prevents blood clots from forming by interfering with a process known as coagulation (or blood clotting).\n\nThe study treatment asundexian is a new type of anticoagulant currently under development to provide further treatment options. Asundexian aims to further improve the standard of care without increasing the risk of bleeding.\n\nThe main purpose of this study is to learn whether asundexian works better than placebo at reducing ischemic strokes in participants who recently had a non-cardioembolic ischemic stroke or TIA/mini-stroke when given in addition to standard antiplatelet therapy. A placebo is a treatment that looks like a medicine but does not have any medicine in it.\n\nAnother aim is to compare the occurrence of major bleeding events during the study between the asundexian and the placebo group. Major bleedings have a serious or even life-threatening impact on a person's health.\n\nDependent on the treatment group, the participants will either take asundexian or placebo as tablets once a day for at least 3 months up to 31 months.\n\nApproximately every 3 months during the treatment period, either a phone call or a visit to the study site is scheduled on an alternating basis. In addition, one visit before and up to two visits after the treatment period are planned.\n\nDuring the study, the study team will:\n\n* Check vital signs such as blood pressure and heart rate\n* Examine the participants' heart health using an electrocardiogram (ECG)\n* Take blood samples\n* Ask the participants questions about how they are feeling and what adverse events they are having.\n\nAn adverse event is any medical problem that a participant has during a study. Doctors keep track of all adverse events that happen in studies, even if they do not think the adverse events might be related to the study treatments. In addition, the participants will be asked to complete a questionnaire on quality of life at certain time points during the study.",

        "DESCRIPTION": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained arrhythmia encountered in clinical practice, accounting for one-third of arrhythmia-related hospitalizations.1 As many as 1 in 4 people develop AF over their lifetime after the age of 40 years. The prevalence and burden of AF in the United States is substantial; the age-adjusted incidence and prevalence has increased over the last 3 decades. Moreover, the number of Americans with AF is expected to increase 150% by 2050. The goals of care in the treatment of AF include (1) the management and reduction of risk factors, (2) prevention of tachycardia (rate control), (3) prevention of stroke, and (4) improvement of symptoms. Reduction or elimination of symptoms often requires rhythm control. Historically, randomized clinical trials have not demonstrated a mortality or stroke benefit with a rhythm control versus a rate control strategy.\n\nDespite the failure of prior randomized clinical trials to demonstrate the superiority of rhythm control, the recent Early Treatment of Atrial Fibrillation for Stroke Prevention 4 (EAST-AFNET 4) trial demonstrated that early introduction of a comprehensive rhythm-control strategy (within one year of diagnosis) is superior to guideline-based usual care in improving cardiovascular (CV) outcomes at a mean follow-up of 5 years. The EAST-AFNET 4 trial found that early rhythm control reduced the primary outcome of CV death, stroke, hospitalization for heart failure (HF), or acute coronary syndrome (HR 0.79, 96% confidence interval (CI) 0.66-0.94, p = 0.005). EAST-AFNET 4 also demonstrated a reduction in the risk of stroke with early introduction of rhythm control (HR 0.65, 95% CI 0.44-0.98), a finding that was also observed with dronedarone in the ATHENA trial. In addition, maintenance of sinus rhythm has been associated with improved quality of life and increased exercise capacity in some patients. Outside of clinical trials, a quality-of-life study from the Registry on Cardiac Rhythm Disorders Assessing the Control of Atrial Fibrillation (RECORD-AF) found that rhythm control was associated with better quality of life.\n\nThere are several antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs) available for rhythm control of AF. Class I antiarrhythmic agents are predominantly limited to younger patients without coronary artery or structural heart disease. Patients with advanced chronic kidney disease, prolonged QT intervals, and/or severe left ventricular hypertrophy should not be treated with sotalol or dofetilide. Even when sotalol or dofetilide can be used, patients are often hesitant to start a medication that requires an inpatient hospitalization for drug loading and laboratory evaluation every 3 months. Amiodarone has been shown to be the most effective AAD for maintaining sinus rhythm in patients with AF; however, based on its side effect profile, amiodarone is only recommended as a first-line agent under specific clinical circumstances. Moreover, despite its efficacy, amiodarone has high rates of discontinuation due to frequent adverse events. In addition to its unfavorable side effects, several studies, including those of patients at risk for sudden cardiac death, have demonstrated an association between amiodarone use and higher mortality, as well as lower functional status. In contrast to amiodarone, dronedarone is a much better tolerated antiarrhythmic medication. In randomized controlled trials, dronedarone has been shown to prevent recurrent AF, improve rate control, and decrease cardiovascular hospitalization in patients with AF.\n\nWhile there are several completed clinical trials that address treatment strategy in patients with symptomatic and recurrent AF, there are no randomized clinical trials that address treatment for first-detected or new-onset AF. After appropriate evaluation for oral anticoagulation, these patients are often started on an atrioventricular nodal blocking agent (beta-blocker or non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker). The investigators hypothesize that earlier administration of a well-tolerated antiarrhythmic drug proven to reduce hospitalization may result in improved quality of life and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with first-detected AF.\n\nRisk Assessment:\n\nDronedarone is approved by the Food and Drug Administration to reduce the risk of hospitalization for AF in patients with paroxysmal or persistent AF. The efficacy and safety of dronedarone 400 mg twice daily was evaluated in five controlled studies, ATHENA, ANDROMEDA, European Trial in Atrial Fibrillation or Flutter Patients Receiving Dronedarone for the Maintenance of Sinus Rhythm (EURIDIS), ADONIS, and Dronedarone Atrial FibrillatioN study after Electrical Cardioversion (DAFNE), involving more than 6,000 patients with including more than 3200 patients who received dronedarone. As with any therapeutic agent, there are known risks with dronedarone therapy. These risks include hepatic injury, heart failure exacerbation, increased exposure to digoxin, increased plasma concentration of tacrolimus, sirolimus, and other Cytochrome P450, family 3, subfamily A (CYP 3A) substrates, and very rare instances of pulmonary toxicity. The risks of dronedarone are felt to be outweighed by its benefits. The guideline recommendations provided by the European Society of Cardiology and American Heart Association (AHA)/American College of Cardiology (ACC)/Heart Rhythm Society (HRS) are commensurate with this risk benefit assessment.\n\nBenefit Assessment:\n\nWhile there are no completed randomized clinical trials to guide selection or initiation of rhythm control therapies in patients with first-detected AF, there are recent trials that suggest benefit with both dronedarone antiarrhythmic therapy and early-initiation of rhythm control in persons with AF. the recent EAST-AFNET 4 trial demonstrated that early introduction of a comprehensive rhythm-control strategy (within one year of diagnosis) is superior to usual guideline-recommended care in improving cardiovascular (CV) outcomes at 5 years. The median time from new-onset AF to randomization in the EAST-AFNET4 trial was 36 days. The trial found that early rhythm control reduced the primary outcome of CV death, stroke, hospitalization for HF, or acute coronary syndrome (HR 0.79, 95% confidence interval 0.66-0.94, p = 0.005). EAST-AFNET 4 also demonstrated a reduction in the risk of stroke with early introduction of rhythm control (HR 0.65, 95% CI 0.44-0.98), a finding that was also observed with dronedarone in the ATHENA trial. Thus, the investigators hypothesize that early initiation of dronedarone in patients with new-onset AF will lead to a reduction in CV hospitalization or death.\n\nOverall Design:\n\nDronedarone is approved by the Food and Drug Administration to reduce the risk of CV hospitalization in patients with AF or atrial flutter. However, it is unknown if dronedarone (or any antiarrhythmic medication) can reduce CV hospitalization or death in patients with first-detected AF. This trial has been designed to address this important question. In order to facilitate the trial enrollment, data collection, and a generalizability to clinical practice, the CHANGE AFIB study has been designed as an open-label pragmatic clinical trial nested within the Get With The Guidelines (GWTG) Atrial Fibrillation registry. At present the overall GWTG program is being implemented in over 2,300 hospitals across the U.S. and is comprised of over 9 million patient records, with an estimated 650,000 new patient records entered per year. The trial will utilize the existing GWTG registry network, data collection architecture, and experience to facilitate both enrollment and conduct of the trial.\n\nThe comparator arm will be \"usual care.\" Thus, this study will compare usual care plus dronedarone versus usual care alone. In most patients, the investigators anticipate usual care to include an atrioventricular nodal blocking agent (beta-blocker, non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker, or digoxin) without an antiarrhythmic. As dronedarone has anti-adrenergic rate controlling properties, a low dose of beta-blocker or calcium-channel blocker is recommended in the USPI when starting dronedarone. In the dronedarone arm concomitant digoxin use will be contraindicated due to P-gp interaction based upon data from the PALLAS trial. All patients will receive oral anticoagulation for stroke prevention according to current guideline recommendations.\n\nCHANGE AFIB will leverage several critical advantages as a pragmatic clinical trial. Data collection will be integrated into the Get With The Guidelines AFIB registry. The use of the GWTG-AFIB registry will also enhance subject recruitment and ensure the enrollment of a diverse group of patients. The randomized intervention will be compared with usual care thus further enhancing generalizability. Follow-up visits will be minimized to reduce patient burden. Moreover, follow-up visits will have \"windows\" to accommodate variation in follow-up intervals at different centers.\n\nJustification for Study Drug Intervention and Dose:\n\nDronedarone is a non-iodinated benzofuran similar to amiodarone but is not associated with thyroid or pulmonary toxicity in randomized clinical trials or post-marketing observational studies. Dronedarone has electrophysiological characteristics spanning all 4 Vaughan-Williams anti-arrhythmic classes, with primarily class III effects. Initial trials suggested that dronedarone prolonged the time to recurrence of AF and reduced cardiovascular death and hospitalization.\n\nThe landmark ATHENA trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of dronedarone in patients with atrial arrhythmias (atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter). This trial did not include patients with a recent history of New York Heart Association (NYHA) class IV heart failure or recent hospitalization for decompensated heart failure (\\<4 weeks). Approximately, 30% of the ATHENA population had NYHA class I-III heart failure. ATHENA demonstrated that dronedarone 400 mg twice daily (in combination with background therapy) reduced the combined endpoint of CV hospitalization or death from any cause by 24% (p\\<0.001) compared with placebo. Of course, the ATHENA trial was not conducted in the special population of patients with a new diagnosis of AF. There are no randomized trials or guideline recommendations for antiarrhythmic therapy at the time of first-detected AF. A subgroup analysis from the ATHENA trial suggests that optimal outcomes may be achieved in those patients with shorter duration of AF (time from diagnosis). Similar observations have also been made in patients undergoing other forms of rhythm control, including catheter ablation. In this trial, patients with first-detected AF will be randomized to dronedarone on top of usual care versus usual care alone. Patients randomized to the intervention arm will be prescribed and treated with Dronedarone 400 mg bid. This dose has been chosen as it is the Food and Drug Administration approved dose as well as the dose recommended in current international guidelines. Dronedarone has also been shown to be an effective rate control agent as well. In the ERATO study treatment with dronedarone 400 mg twice daily let to a mean reduction of 24.5 beat/min in patients with permanent AF when compared with placebo. In the EURIDIS/ADONIS studies the mean difference in patients with paroxysmal/persistent AF during AF recurrence was 14 beats/min. Moreover, the dronedarone treated patients experienced improved rate control without any reduction in exercise tolerance as measured by maximal exercise.",
        "SUMMARY": "While there are several completed clinical trials that address treatment strategy in patients with symptomatic and recurrent AF, there are no randomized clinical trials that address treatment for first-detected AF. In usual care, these patients are started on an atrioventricular nodal blocking agent (beta-blocker or non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker) along with stroke prevention therapy. The investigators hypothesize that earlier administration of a well-tolerated antiarrhythmic drug proven to reduce hospitalization may result in improved cardiovascular outcomes and quality of life in patients first-detected AF.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to determine if treatment with dronedarone on top of usual care is superior to usual care alone for the prevention of cardiovascular hospitalization or death from any cause in patients hospitalized with first-detected AF. All patients will be treated with guideline-recommended stroke prevention therapy according to the CHA2DS2-VASc score. The treatment follow-up period will be 12 months. There will be two follow-up visits. Consistent with the pragmatic nature of the trial, the first follow-up will occur between 3 -9 months and the 2nd will occur at 12 months (with a window of +/- 30 days). Approximately 3000 patients will be enrolled and randomly assigned (1:1) to study intervention.

All patients will have their historical bone marrow samples and/or peripheral blood drawn during screening stained for WT1 via IHC and/or analyzed via PCR by central pathology review. The primary goal of the study will be to demonstrate an advantage for GPS in overall survival in these patient populations. The study will enroll approximately 140 patients and will be conducted at about 110 investigational sites. Patients will be randomized 1:1 to GPS or BAT stratified by whether they are in CR2 or CRp2, their cytogenetic risk at diagnosis (poor vs all other), whether they harbor minimal residual disease (MRD), and the duration of CR1 of less than one year or one year or more.\n\nPatients on the BAT arm may be treated with 1. observation (whereby palliative management with hydroxyurea is allowed), 2. a hypomethylating agent (decitabine or azacitidine), 3. venetoclax and/or 4. low-dose ara-C. Patients whose remission in CR2 can be maintained with molecularly targeted agents (e.g. FLT-3 or IDH inhibitors) per investigator's determination will not be eligible. However, there are no restrictions on prior use of any agents in the CR1 setting. Patients cannot receive GPS as an adjunct therapy to any other agents.\n\nPatients on the GPS arm will receive 70 \u03bcg of sargramostim (GM-CSF) on Day -2 and Day 1 before each injection of GPS. The first two administrations of GM-CSF will take place at the same anatomical site as the planned administration of GPS within each treatment cycle. GPS will be administered as an immunization induction every 2 weeks for 6 administrations (Weeks 0 - 10); this will be followed by a 4-week period of no treatment. Treatment will then resume for 6 administrations as an initial booster phase every 4 weeks (Weeks 14 - 34) which will again be followed by a period of no treatment lasting 6 weeks. GPS will be resumed after this period as a second booster phase and will be administered every 6 weeks for 3 administrations (Weeks 40 - 52). Following each administration of GM-CSF or GPS, patients will be observed for approximately 30 minutes. An End of Treatment visit will be conducted 30 days following the last dose of GPS. Patients will then enter the long-term follow-up portion of the trial where they will be followed for recurrence of leukemia and overall survival.\n\nTo ensure a comparable level of observation, patients randomized to the BAT arm will be seen every 4 weeks through Week 52.\n\nAll patients will undergo bone marrow aspirates and biopsies at screening, Week 12 and end of treatment. Bone marrow examinations will then be repeated as clinically indicated. Patients will be assessed for safety at each clinic encounter. The primary endpoint will be overall survival.",

        "DESCRIPTION": "Multiple myeloma is an incurable, malignant, plasma cell disorder. Teclistamab (JNJ-64007957) is a full-size, Immunoglobulin G (IgG) 4 proline, alanine, and alanine (PAA) bispecific antibody that targets the cluster of differentiation (CD3) receptor expressed on the surface of T cells and B cell maturation antigen (BCMA). With its dual binding sites, teclistamab is able to draw CD3 positive T cells in close proximity to BCMA positive cells, resulting in T-cell activation and subsequent lysis of BCMA positive cells. Pomalidomide is a third-generation immunomodulatory imide drug (IMiD) that exerts potent, direct tumoricidal and immune-enhancing effects and Carfilzomib is a second-generation proteasome inhibitor that inhibits proteasome which results in disruption of protein turnover and induces apoptosis. The primary hypothesis of this study is that teclistamab monotherapy (Arm A) will significantly improve progression free survival (PFS) compared with investigator's choice of PVd or Kd (Arm B) in participants with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who have received 1 to 3 prior lines of therapy, including an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody and lenalidomide. The study will include a screening phase, treatment phase, and follow-up phase.

        "SUMMARY": "This phase II trial tests whether mosunetuzumab and/or polatuzumab vedotin helps benefit patients who have received chemotherapy (fludarabine and cyclophosphamide) followed by chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy (tisagenlecleucel, axicabtagene ciloleucel, or lisocabtagene maraleucel) for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma that has come back (recurrent) or that does not respond to treatment (refractory) or grade IIIb follicular lymphoma. Mosunetuzumab is a monoclonal antibody that may interfere with the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Polatuzumab vedotin is a monoclonal antibody, called polatuzumab, linked to a drug called vedotin. Polatuzumab is a form of targeted therapy because it attaches to specific molecules (receptors) on the surface of cancer cells, and delivers vedotin to kill them. Chemotherapy drugs, such as fludarabine and cyclophosphamide, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. CAR T-cell therapy is a type of treatment in which a patient's T cells (a type of immune system cell) are changed in the laboratory so they will attack cancer cells. T cells are taken from a patient's blood. Then the gene for a special receptor that binds to a certain protein on the patient's cancer cells is added to the T cells in the laboratory. The special receptor is called a chimeric antigen receptor. Large numbers of the CAR T cells are grown in the laboratory and given to the patient by infusion for treatment of certain cancers. Giving mosunetuzumab and/or polatuzumab vedotin after chemotherapy and CAR T-cell therapy may be more effective at controlling or shrinking the cancer than not giving them.",

        "SUMMARY": "This phase I trial tests the safety, side effects, and best dose of emavusertib (CA-4948) in combination with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel in treating patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma that has spread from where it first started (primary site) to other places in the body (metastatic) or cannot be removed by surgery (unresectable). CA-4948 is in a class of medications called kinase inhibitors. It works by blocking the action of abnormal proteins called interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 4 (IRAK4) and FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) that signal cells to multiply. This may help keep cancer cells from growing. The usual approach for patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is treatment with chemotherapy drugs gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel. Gemcitabine is a chemotherapy drug that blocks the cells from making DNA and may kill cancer cells. Paclitaxel is in a class of medications called anti-microtubule agents. It stops cancer cells from growing and dividing and may kill them. Nab-paclitaxel is an albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation of paclitaxel which may have fewer side effects and work better than other forms of paclitaxel. Giving CA-4948 in combination with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel may shrink or stabilize metastatic or unresectable pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.",

        "DESCRIPTION": "The landmark trials that established breast conservation therapy (BCT) (breast-conserving surgery followed by adjuvant breast irradiation) as a suitable alternative to mastectomy were conducted in an era that predated biological subtyping of breast cancer and the use of HER2-directed therapies in patients with HER2+ cancers. These trials established adjuvant radiotherapy following breast-conserving surgery as necessary to maximize local control, yet, in the intervening years, overall outcomes have improved significantly owing to widespread adoption of screening mammography, resulting in a substantial reduction in average tumor size at diagnosis, as well as improvements in surgical techniques and, crucial for this proposal, the development of highly active systemic therapies.\n\nBefore the development of HER2-targeted therapies, patients with HER2-driven localized breast cancer had among the highest rates of local recurrence. However, with improved identification of these patients and the advent of HER2-directed therapies, outcomes have improved significantly, and trials have sought to optimize treatment to reduce the morbidity of both local and systemic treatment. Among the most salient of these examples is the APT trial, a single-arm adjuvant study that enrolled 410 breast cancer patients with HER2+ tumors \u2264 3cm in size and negative axillary nodes, who received adjuvant systemic therapy with weekly paclitaxel and trastuzumab for 12 weeks (TH) followed by 9 months of trastuzumab monotherapy. In addition to demonstrating a very low incidence of distant recurrence, among those on the trial who underwent BCT (lumpectomy and radiation, n = 244), only 2 local recurrence (LR) events have been reported after 7 years of follow-up (7-year LR = 1.2%), representing among the most favorable local outcomes of any breast cancer cohort studied to date. Confirmatory results are forthcoming from the ATEMPT trial, which evaluated the antibody-drug conjugate T-DM1 (ado-trastuzumab emtansine) (n=383) vs the TH regimen from the APT trial (n = 114), thus far showing only 3 LRs in each arm with a median 3-years of follow-up. Importantly, per the current standard of care for HER2+ patients undergoing BCT, all patients presumably received adjuvant breast radiotherapy.\n\nThe balance of the BCT literature, including a landmark meta-analysis by the Early Breast Cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group, suggests that adjuvant radiotherapy approximately halves the risk of local recurrence following lumpectomy across all analyzable subgroups. While the relative benefit appears constant across subgroups, the absolute benefit of adjuvant radiotherapy varies with the underlying risk. Taking the favorable results of the APT trial (1.2% 7-year LR), if one presumes that omission of radiotherapy yields a doubling or tripling of local recurrence (based on the observed RR of 0.5 - 0.66 for those receiving radiotherapy across the preponderance of historical trials), this population might have manifested a LR rate of 2.4 - 3.6% with the omission of radiotherapy. That is to say, the hypothesis is that administration of RT to APT patients undergoing BCT may have reduced the 7-year absolute risk of LR by only 1.2-2.4%. Through the identification of patients who are at low risk of LR, it may be acceptable for such patients to forego radiation. This hypothesis will be studied by evaluating omission of radiotherapy among patients with pT1N0 disease at breast-conserving surgery who receive adjuvant HER2-directed therapy (trastuzumab/paclitaxel preferred, other options per protocol), or with clinical tumors \u2264 3 cm and clinically negative axillary nodes (cN0) who achieve a pathologic complete response (pCR; ypT0N0) following preoperative (neoadjuvant) administration of HER2-directed therapy (trastuzumab/paclitaxel preferred, other options per protocol). It is expcted that the 5-year LR rate for this population omitting radiotherapy will be 2% or less, and that omission of radiation will not have a measurable impact on regional and distant recurrences or overall survival.\n\nThe practice of breast radiation oncology has benefited immensely from practice-changing trials that have refined the application of adjuvant radiotherapy since the early surgical studies determined whole breast radiotherapy to be necessary following lumpectomy. There are now several favorable breast cancer subtypes in which patients routinely forego radiotherapy after trials demonstrating modest benefits in terms of local recurrence and no impact on distant recurrence or survival, such as among small, low grade luminal cancers in older women and \"good-risk\" DCIS. Therefore, this will study the omission of radiotherapy among a population of HER2+ breast cancer patients who are now appreciated to also have favorable risk, so as to similarly weigh the attendant inconveniences, cost and morbidity of radiotherapy in light of an established absolute benefit, which may prove to be modest.",

(Part 2 \\[Expansion cohort\\]).\n\nOUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of ASTX727 in combination with fixed-dose pembrolizumab and fixed or reduced-dose paclitaxel, followed by a dose-expansion study.\n\nPatients receive ASTX727 orally (PO) on days 1-4, paclitaxel intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15, and pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1 of each cycle. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo collection of blood samples and computed tomography (CT) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) throughout the trial. Patients in the dose-expansion phase also undergo a tumor biopsy during screening and day 1 of the treatment cycle 2 of the study.\n\nPatients will be followed every 6 months for 3 years post registration or until death, whichever occurs first.",
        "SUMMARY": "This phase I trial tests the safety, side effects, and best dose of ASTX727 when given in combination with a usual approach of treatment with paclitaxel and pembrolizumab in patients with triple-negative breast cancer that has spread from where it first started (primary site) to other places in the body (metastatic). The usual approach is defined as care most people get for this type of cancer. The usual approach for patients with metastatic triple negative breast cancer who are not in a study is chemotherapy with drugs like paclitaxel, carboplatin, cisplatin, eribulin, vinorelbine, capecitabine, gemcitabine, doxorubicin or cyclophosphamide. There is a protein called PD-L1 that helps regulate the body's immune system. For patients who have PD-L1+ tumors, immunotherapy (pembrolizumab) is usually added to paclitaxel or carboplatin/gemcitabine as initial treatment. For patients who have PD-L1-negative tumors, chemotherapy alone is used, without immunotherapy. ASTX727 is a combination of two drugs, decitabine and cedazuridine. Cedazuridine is in a class of medications called cytidine deaminase inhibitors. It prevents the breakdown of decitabine, making it more available in the body so that decitabine will have a greater effect. Decitabine is in a class of medications called hypomethylation agents. It works by helping the bone marrow produce normal blood cells and by killing abnormal cells in the bone marrow. Paclitaxel is in a class of medications called antimicrotubule agents. It stops tumor cells from growing and dividing and may kill them. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving ASTX727 with usual treatment approach with paclitaxel and pembrolizumab may be able to shrink or stabilize the tumor for longer than the usual approach alone in patients with metastatic triple negative breast cancer.",

        "SUMMARY": "This phase II trial tests whether decitabine and cedazuridine (ASTX727) in combination with venetoclax work better than ASTX727 alone at decreasing symptoms of bone marrow cancer in patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), myelodysplastic syndrome/myeloproliferative neoplasm (MDS/MPN) with excess blasts. Blasts are immature blood cells. Decitabine is in a class of medications called hypomethylation agents. It works by helping the bone marrow produce normal blood cells and by killing abnormal cells in the bone marrow. Cobimetinib is used in patients whose cancer has a mutated (changed) form of a gene called BRAF. It is in a class of medications called kinase inhibitors. It works by blocking the action of an abnormal protein that signals cancer cells to multiply. This helps slow or stop the spread of cancer cells. Venetoclax is in a class of medications called B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) inhibitors. It may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking Bcl-2, a protein needed for cancer cell survival. The combination of ASTX727 and venetoclax may be more effective in reducing the cancer signs and symptoms in patients with CMML, or MDS/MPN with excess blasts.",

        "SUMMARY": "This phase III trial compares perioperative chemotherapy (given before and after surgery) versus adjuvant chemotherapy (given after surgery) for the treatment of pancreatic cancer that can be removed by surgery (removable/resectable). Chemotherapy drugs, such as fluorouracil, irinotecan, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving chemotherapy before and after surgery (perioperatively) may work better in treating patients with pancreatic cancer compared to giving chemotherapy after surgery (adjuvantly).",

        "SUMMARY": "This phase III trial compares total ablative therapy and usual systemic therapy to usual systemic therapy alone in treating patients with colorectal cancer that has spread to up to 4 body sites (limited metastatic). The usual approach for patients who are not participating in a study is treatment with intravenous (IV) (through a vein) and/or oral medications (systemic therapy) to help stop the cancer sites from getting larger and the spread of the cancer to additional body sites. Ablative means that the intention of the local treatment is to eliminate the cancer at that metastatic site. The ablative local therapy will consist of very focused, intensive radiotherapy called stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) with or without surgical resection and/or microwave ablation, which is a procedure where a needle is temporarily inserted in the tumor and heat is used to destroy the cancer cells. SABR, surgical resection, and microwave ablation have been tested for safety, but it is not scientifically proven that the addition of these treatments are beneficial for your stage of cancer. The addition of ablative local therapy to all known metastatic sites to the usual approach of systemic therapy could shrink or remove the tumor(s) or prevent the tumor(s) from returning.",

        "SUMMARY": "This phase II trial compares the effect of immunotherapy with ipilimumab and nivolumab alone to their combination with cabozantinib in treating patients with soft tissue sarcoma that has spread from where it first started to nearby tissue, lymph nodes, or distant parts of the body (advanced). Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as ipilimumab and nivolumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Cabozantinib is in a class of medications called kinase inhibitors. It works by blocking the action of an abnormal protein that signals cancer cells to multiply and may also prevent the growth of new blood vessels that tumors need to grow. By these actions it may help slow or stop the spread of cancer cells. Adding cabozantinib to the combination of ipilimumab and nivolumab may be better in stopping or slowing the growth of tumor compared to ipilimumab and nivolumab alone in patients with advanced soft tissue sarcoma.",

        "SUMMARY": "This phase III trial compares the effect of modified fluorouracil, leucovorin calcium, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan (mFOLFIRINOX) to modified fluorouracil, leucovorin calcium, and oxaliplatin (mFOLFOX) for the treatment of advanced, unresectable, or metastatic HER2 negative esophageal, gastroesophageal junction, and gastric adenocarcinoma. The usual approach for patients is treatment with FOLFOX chemotherapy. Chemotherapy drugs work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Fluorouracil stops cells from making DNA and it may kill tumor cells. Leucovorin is used with fluorouracil to enhance the effects of the drug. Oxaliplatin works by killing, stopping, or slowing the growth of tumor cells. Some patients also receive an immunotherapy drug, nivolumab, in addition to FOLFOX chemotherapy. Immunotherapy may induce changes in body's immune system and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Irinotecan blocks certain enzymes needed for cell division and DNA repair, and it may kill tumor cells. Adding irinotecan to the FOLFOX regimen could shrink the cancer and extend the life of patients with advanced gastroesophageal cancers.",

        "DESCRIPTION": "The Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) established the Nulliparous Pregnancy Outcomes Study: Monitoring Mothers-to-be (nuMoM2b) to study women for whom the current pregnancy will lead to their first delivery (nulliparas). About 40% of pregnant women in the United States are nulliparas. Because little or no information from previous pregnancy outcomes is available to guide assignment of risk or mitigating interventions, adverse pregnancy outcomes in nulliparas are especially unpredictable. The underlying mechanisms of adverse pregnancy outcomes such as preterm birth, preeclampsia, fetal growth restriction and stillbirth are interrelated and therefore will be evaluated as part of this study. The information gained will benefit women who are pregnant or who are considering pregnancy and their physicians. In addition, the knowledge will support future research aimed at improving care and health outcomes for a critical group of at-risk women who are currently understudied.\n\nThe study is a prospective cohort study of a racially/ethnically/geographically diverse population of 10,038 nulliparous women with singleton gestations. The women undergo intensive research assessments during the course of their pregnancies to study the mechanisms for and prediction of adverse pregnancy outcomes (APOs) in women in their first pregnancy. The APOs of primary interest are preterm birth, preeclampsia and fetal growth restriction.\n\nThe goals of the study are to 1) determine maternal characteristics, including genetics, epigenetics, and physiological response to pregnancy as well as environmental factors that influence and/or predict adverse pregnancy outcome; 2) identify specific aspects of placental development and function that lead to adverse pregnancy outcome; and 3) characterize genetic, growth, and developmental parameters of the fetus that are associated with adverse pregnancy outcome.\n\nEight academic medical centers or sites had primary responsibility for enrollment and follow-up of study participants. Several of these sites collected data through additional academic research centers or nearby hospitals (subsites). A Data Coordinating and Analysis Center (DCAC) provided input to the protocol, manages the data, and analyzes the data. Investigators from these institutions have established a partnership with NICHD staff to develop and implement the study protocol and ancillary studies that acquire and analyze data to identify biomarkers and understand the mechanism and prediction of preterm birth and other adverse pregnancy outcomes.\n\nNulliparous women with an in utero singleton gestation between 6 weeks 0 days and 13 weeks 6 days of pregnancy were recruited through the eight clinical sites and their subsites. Mechanisms were created in the various prenatal clinics associated with the sites to identify eligible nulliparous women with singleton pregnancies. Once enrolled, a participant was followed for the duration of her pregnancy by research staff at the clinical site. Study visits were scheduled at four times during the pregnancy: 6 weeks 0 days through 13 weeks 6 days estimated gestational age (EGA), 16 weeks 0 days through 21 weeks 6 days EGA, 22 weeks 0 days through 29 weeks 6 days EGA, and at the time of delivery. Data were collected through personal interview, self-administered questionnaires, clinical measurement, chart abstraction, and collection of biological specimens (blood, urine, cervico-vaginal fluid). Additional data (i.e., sleep breathing assessments, actigraphy, fetal adrenal gland measurements) were collected through ancillary research studies on subsets of the enrolled women. The set-ups for screening, enrollment and follow-up of participants varied by clinical site and subsite. However, in each setting, the clinical site staffs included study investigators, research nurses, research assistants and sonographers. Clinical site staffs were trained to interview participants, collect and process samples, conduct various research tests, and input data. Data are managed at the DCAC. Specimens are stored at the NICHD specimen repository for later analysis.",
        "SUMMARY": "Forty percent of pregnant women in the United States are women who have never given birth. As a group, they sometimes have complications with their pregnancy, but there is no information from a previous pregnancy to identify who might have a problem. Very little research has been done with this group. The Nulliparous Pregnancy Outcomes Study: Monitoring Mothers-to-be (nuMoM2b) is collecting data from a diverse population of about 10,000 women who are having their first baby and are carrying only one baby. The women are enrolled early in pregnancy and undergo research assessments four times during their pregnancies. Data are collected through interviews, self-completed data forms, clinical measurements, ultrasound, and collection and storage of blood samples, urine samples, and fluid from the vagina and cervix. Some information comes from medical records. A subset of women may be asked to participate in substudies collecting information on sleep breathing, sleep patterns and quality, or other areas possibly related to birth outcomes. The goal of the research is to find ways to identify women in this group who might develop a problem with their pregnancy and use this information to improve the health of pregnant women and their babies in the future. The study is focusing on pregnancy problems like high blood pressure, babies that are born much too early and very small babies.",

        "DESCRIPTION": "Purpose:\n\nOpioid antagonists at ultra-low doses have been used with opioid agonists to prevent or limit opioid tolerance. Remifentanil, a rapid onset/offset opioid that is often used as an anesthesia adjunct intraoperatively, has been associated with the development of hyperalgesia and opioid tolerance postoperatively. Opioid-induced hyperalgesia (OIH) induced by remifentanil intraoperatively may be a factor contributing to an increase in postoperative pain as well as difficulty in controlling such pain. The purpose of this study will be to evaluate whether an ultra-low dose of naloxone, an opioid antagonist, could block remifentanil-induced hyperalgesia and tolerance following surgery.\n\nThis research will help elucidate the degree of OIH after surgeries involving remifentanil and determine if a new technique can be employed to decrease remifentanil-induced OIH. By mitigating OIH, patients should have a decrease in postoperative pain and an increase in patient satisfaction at UCI and other hospitals where such a technique is employed.\n\nThere are 3 study groups: (1) low dose remifentanil (LO, 0.1 micrograms/kg/mL), (2) high dose remifentanil (0.4 mg) combined with placebo (HI, 0.4 micrograms/kg/mL), or (3) high dose remifentanil (0.4 mg) combined with ultra-low dose naloxone (HN, 0.004 micrograms/kg/mL naloxone).\n\nBackground:\n\nOpioid-induced hyperalgesia is a paradoxical increase in pain sensitivity following opioid exposure. The mechanism for this is likely due to an alteration in opioid receptor signaling with disruption of G-protein coupling and opioid-induced activation and hypertrophy of spinal glial cells (gliosis). Opioid-induced hyperalgesia has been noted with many different opioids, and the most well documented hyperalgesic effect is with remifentanil.\n\nVarious agents have been used in an attempt to reduce the development hyperalgesia following remifentanil. While there are few reports on the effect of ultra-low dose naloxone on opioid-induced hyperalgesia, recent evidence is emerging regarding its use in pain management. Ultra-low dose naloxone has been shown to prevent remifentanil-induced pain hypersensitivities (allodynia and hyperalgesia) in rats. However, there are little to no studies on reducing the adverse effects of remifentanil with naloxone in human subjects.\n\nExisting knowledge and previous research:\n\nAttempts have been made with various agents to reduce the development of tolerance and hyperalgesia following remifentanil. Postoperative hyperalgesia and its prevention has been studied with ketamine , Magnesium , Gabapentin, Clonidine, Lornoxicam , Dextromethorphan , Paracetamol , Morphine , Dexmedetomidine , Adenosine, COX inhibitors , Amantadine , Nitrous oxide, Fentanyl, Pregabalin , Buprenorphine, Midazolam, Dexamethasone. Relevant to our current hypothesis is the report that concomitant administration of ultra-low dose naloxone and naltrexone with remifentanil prevented OIH. However, there are no studies on reducing the adverse effects of remifentanil with ultra-low dose naloxone in human subjects.\n\nWhile the traditional role of opiate antagonists have been in cases of opioid overmedication, recent evidence is emerging regarding their use in pain management. Gan et al. 1997 used an ultra-low dose naloxone infusion (0.00025 mg/kg/h or 0.001 mg/kg/h) in postoperative patients receiving IV morphine via a patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) device. Good pain relief was experienced in all groups, however consumption of PCA morphine was significantly reduced in patients that received the lowest infusion of naloxone and opioid-induced side effects (nausea, vomiting, pruritus) were reduced by naloxone at both dose.\n\nNaloxone and/or naltrexone at ultra-low doses may enhance the analgesic effects of opioids, enhance the antinociceptive effects of methadone, and decrease or block the development of opioid tolerance in rodents. The combination of oxycodone with an ultra-low dose of the antagonist naltrexone as a singular oral medication, Oxytrex, has been developed to prevent the development of tolerance in the treatment of moderate to severe chronic pain.\n\nAguado et. al. 2013 recently evaluated the effects of the opioid antagonist, naloxone, on remifentanil-induced tolerance or hyperalgesia in rats. Hyperalgesia was considered to be a decrease in mechanical nociceptive thresholds (von Frey), while opioid tolerance was considered to be a decrease in sevoflurane MAC reduction by remifentanil. An ultra-low dose of naloxone was able to block remifentanil-induced hyperalgesia and the MAC increase associated with hyperalgesia, but did not change opioid tolerance under inhaled anesthesia.",
        "SUMMARY": "The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether using ultra-low dose naloxone, an opioid antagonist, has the potential to block remifentanil-induced hyperalgesia and tolerance following surgery.\n\nThere are 3 study groups: (1) low dose remifentanil (LO, 0.1 micrograms/kg/mL), (2) high dose remifentanil (0.4 mg) combined with placebo (HI, 0.4 micrograms/kg/mL), or (3) high dose remifentanil (0.4 mg) combined with ultra-low dose naloxone (HN, 0.004 micrograms/kg/mL naloxone).\n\nThe hypothesis of the study is that occurrence of remifentanil-induced hyperalgesia (low score in mechanical pain threshold) in the HN group will be lower than in the HI group.",
