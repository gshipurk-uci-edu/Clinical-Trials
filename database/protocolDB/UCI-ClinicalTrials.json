It works by blocking the action of mutated BRAF that signals cancer cells to multiply. This helps to stop or slow the spread of cancer cells. Cetuximab is in a class of medications called monoclonal antibodies. It binds to a protein called EGFR, which is found on some types of cancer cells. This may help keep cancer cells from growing. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving nivolumab in combination with encorafenib and cetuximab may be more effective than encorafenib and cetuximab alone at stopping tumor growth and spreading in patients with metastatic or unresectable BRAF-mutant colorectal cancer.", "STATUS": "RECRUITING", "PRIMARY_OUTCOMES": "[{'measure': 'Progression-free survival (PFS)', 'description': 'Conducted in all eligible participants according to the intent-to-treat principle using the stratified log rank test when a total of 66 PFS events have been observed.

To compare the incidence of residual disease at the time of re-resection between patients with IGBC who receive perioperative chemotherapy prior to re-resection and those who receive only adjuvant chemotherapy after re-resection.\n\nII. To assess the clinical effect of preoperative chemotherapy compared to upfront re-resection on resectability among 3 cohorts: all enrolled patients, all patients who undergo staging laparoscopy, and all patients who undergo laparotomy.\n\nIII. To determine the difference in progression-free survival (PFS) for patients with IGBC who receive perioperative chemotherapy prior to and after re-resection compared to patients who receive only adjuvant chemotherapy after re-resection.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.\n\nARM I: Within 4 weeks of randomization, patients undergo surgery to remove part of the liver, the lymph nodes around the liver, and possibly the bile ducts.

Approximately 4-8 weeks after completion of chemotherapy, patients whose disease has not spread to other places in the body (metastasized) undergo surgery as in Arm I.

Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 4 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years, then every 6 months for 1 year after surgery or until disease recurrence, whichever comes first, for up to 5 years.", "SUMMARY": "This phase II/III trial compares the effect of adding chemotherapy before and after surgery versus after surgery alone (usual treatment) in treating patients with stage II-III gallbladder cancer. Chemotherapy drugs, such as gemcitabine and cisplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving chemotherapy before surgery may make the tumor smaller; therefore, may reduce the extent of surgery. Additionally, it may make it easier for the surgeon to distinguish between normal and cancerous tissue. Giving chemotherapy after surgery may kill any remaining tumor cells.

However, large numbers of neutrophils infiltrating in the inflamed mucosa and accumulating in the epithelium cause damage of mucosal architecture, compromised epithelial barrier and production of inflammatory mediators. Novel neutrophil-related serum markers are emerging in the literature and are valid candidates to surrogate markers for mucosal healing (MH). NGAL is an anti-bacterial protein, whereas MMP-9 is a protein with enzymatic activity towards extracellular matrix (ECM) and non-ECM components, and is involved in cell signaling.\n\nBy formation of a complex between NGAL and MMP-9, NGAL is thought to protect MMP-9 from autodegradation. Cathelicidin LL37 is the 37 amino acids C-terminal part of human cationic antimicrobial protein (hCAP)18 and acts as an antimicrobial protein (AMP). It is found in lysosomes of macrophages and polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) as well as keratinocytes and plays a role in the early host response against invading pathogens via its broad-spectrum anti-microbial activity. The expression of LL37 was found to be increased in the inflamed mucosa of patients with UC and CD3. Moreover, increased colonic LL37 expression in macrophages and epithelium was observed during colitis in UC patients. Chitinase 3 like 1 (CHI3L1), also known as YKL-40, is a 39 kDa secreted glycoprotein member of the glycosyl hydrolase 18 family although it does not show chitotriosidase activity. It is secreted by macrophages and neutrophils and acts as a growth factor for vascular endothelial cells and fibroblasts.\n\nIn previous retrospective single-site study, consisting of serum samples and endoscopic evaluation before and after anti-TNFa treatment from 176 moderate-to-severe UC patients and 75 healthy controls, showed that the combined use of these markers is statistically significant and can accurately correlate with the Mayo endoscopic subscore (MES) and identify endoscopic response to infliximab (IFX) and adalimumab (ADM. An algorithm, the Ulcerative Colitis Response Index (UCRI), a unit-less index ranging from 0 (likely a responder) to 10 (likely a non-responder) was constructed and identified accentually the anti-TNFa non-responders' patients as measured by endoscopic assessment MES \u22652.\n\nGlycominds, LLC (the \"Sponsor\") in support of the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation (CCF) IBD Venture will conduct this prospective multicenter longitudinal study in the U.S. Following screening and patient enrollment based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria Imaging, blood (serum) and fecal samples will be collected at certain predefined time points from bio na\u00efve (na\u00efve) and from anti-TNFa previously exposed (exposed) active (MES \\>2) UC patients that will start an anti-TNFa treatment or switch from one anti-TNFa type to another (infliximab-IFX or biosimilars, adalimumab-ADM, golimumab-GOM) at time of recruitment. Collected blood and stool samples will be used to determine the accuracy and prediction value of the UCRI biomarker panel and algorithm in comparison with endoscopic healing (measured as end point of MES \u2264 2) and in comparison to fecal Calprotectin.

Another reason is to explore additional biomarkers in blood, stool or voice to detect disease activity and/or mucosal healing.

Drugs listed in the \"drugs to avoid in CLQTS (congenital long QT syndrome)\" and \"known risk of TdP (torsade de pointes)\" should be excluded. Granisetron is an acceptable antiemetic on this study. If a patient must take ondansetron, they may NOT take any other concomitant agents which might impact their QTc.\n* Patients must have UGT1A1 testing at screening. Patients homozygous or heterozygous for A(TA)7TAA in the promoter region, or homozygous or heterozygous for the G71R allele (also known as UGT1A1\\*6) are excluded (i.e., patients with Gilbert syndrome or Gilbert carriers) as they are at risk for further reduction of UGT1A1 activity that may disrupt bilirubin clearance\n* Patients with uncontrolled intercurrent illness. Additionally, patients with acute liver disease, poorly controlled liver disease, or cirrhosis are excluded\n* Patients with (known) active or poorly controlled alcohol use disorder are excluded\n* Pregnant women are excluded from this study because novobiocin is a POLtheta inhibitor agent with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects.

Several seminal randomized clinical trials conducted in the 1980's era demonstrated that breast radiotherapy following lumpectomy yielded overall survival outcomes equivalent to mastectomy for treatment of early stage invasive breast cancer leading to the National Institute of Health (NIH) Consensus Conference statement in 1991 supporting breast conservation treatment.This established lumpectomy with RT as an alternative to mastectomy and subsequently the rate of breast conservation for eligible breast cancer patients rose steadily. Shortly thereafter, investigators recognized that the toxicity, patient burden, and geographic barriers associated with the protracted treatment course for breast RT was a potential barrier to breast conservation utilization. Numerous phase III clinical trials were conducted randomizing women post lumpectomy to RT vs. observation aimed at identifying which cases did not derive a significant RT benefit. No such subsets of breast cancer patients were consistently identified, thereby solidifying the standard that breast conservation required both lumpectomy and RT. Two meta-analyses by the Early Breast Cancer Trialists Collaborative Group (EBCTCG) in 2005 and 2011 further reinforced the value of breast RT post lumpectomy by examining the relationship of local recurrence and breast cancer mortality relative to the use of breast RT post lumpectomy. In each analysis, it found for axillary node negative breast cancer patients undergoing breast conservation a small but consistent increase in breast cancer mortality when breast radiotherapy was omitted. As a result, breast RT after lumpectomy has become an established paradigm for breast conservation for early stage breast cancer and is recommended by the NCCN 2018 guidelines (as it has for nearly two decades) that are commonly used today by clinicians and health systems alike. The landscape of early stage breast cancer has changed dramatically over the past three decades since the establishment of breast conservation. Widespread screening with mammography has led to the diagnosis of smaller and earlier stage disease. All breast cancers are now routinely characterized by their hormone sensitivity based on the presence of estrogen and progesterone receptors on tumor cells within the biopsy or surgical specimen and presence of HER2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2) which has provided an additional means of stratifying breast cancer into distinct prognostic groups. Small, node negative invasive breast cancer that is hormone sensitive (HS) and HER2-negative has a lower overall recurrence rate (local, regional, and distant) than breast cancers characterized by more adverse clinical pathologic features. However, other than in a smaller subset of women greater than 70 years old, clinical trials in this HS population still demonstrated unacceptable local recurrence risks long term after lumpectomy alone emphasizing that clinical and pathologic features are insufficient for consistently identifying when RT can safely be omitted.", "SUMMARY": "This Phase III Trial evaluates whether breast

The latter are presumed to be \"Controls\", though this final determination is made as part of study conduct, not at the time of enrollment.\n\nThe study is divided into a Run-In phase and an Efficacy phase. The assignment of a patient to one or the other of these two phases will be made based on two pieces of information: 1) the Final Study Diagnosis (as defined below) and 2) the current tally versus the pre-determined target number of patients already assigned to each of the subgroups (e.g., non-dysplastic Barrett's Esophagus (NDBE), high grade dysplasia {HGD\\]) for each phase. Patients will first be enrolled into the Run-In phase subgroups. Only once the targeted enrollment for a given Run-In phase subgroup has been reached, subsequent patients with a particular diagnosis will be assigned to the appropriate Efficacy Phase subgroup, until the targeted total number is reached. Run In phase data will be maintained in a separate database from Efficacy phase data. Study conduct is identical in both phases; however, data from each phase will be segregated and analysis of each phase will be used solely for its predetermined purpose without any co-mingling of data. Once assigned, no patient, or their data, will be re-assigned or moved from being a Run-In phase patient to being an Efficacy phase patient, or from the Run-In phase database to the Efficacy phase database, or vice versa.\n\nThe Run-In phase will enroll the initial 60 short segment NDBE (also known as short segment Barrett's Esophagus \\[SSBE\\]) and 25 long segment NDBE (also known as long segment Barrett's Esophagus \\[LSBE\\]) Cases, the initial 10 low grade dysplasia \\[LGD\\] Cases, the initial 3 high grade dysplasia \\[HGD\\] Cases, and the initial 2 intramucosal adenocarcinoma \\[IMC\\] Cases, as well as the initial 100 Controls. The Efficacy phase will enroll 54 Cases each with a Final Study Diagnosis of NDBE, LGD, HGD, and IMC, and 54 Controls.\n\nRun-In phase data will be used solely to derive the optimal numerical cutoffs by which to score mVIM and mCCNA1 (which are two genes where the methylated DNA changes are located) positivity or negativity. These cutoffs serve as the key inputs into an algorithm by which an overall EsoGuard result of positive versus negative is determined. The setting of these cutoffs will be done by Sponsor personnel with full access to all Run-In phase data; the goal will be to optimize overall EsoGuard assay sensitivity and specificity for its intended use as a screening test in the at-risk population. The assay, once validated and locked, will be used to analyze patients' distal esophageal cells obtained in both the Efficacy phase of this Case Control study as well as in a separate Screening study (PR-1039/EG-CL-101) to be conducted in parallel. Only Run-In phase data will be used to set cutoffs. The mVIM and mCCNA1 (i.e., genes with methylated DNA changes) cutoffs will be set and then the EsoGuard assay re validated and \"locked\", all before any Efficacy phase distal esophageal cells specimens collected from study patients will undergo EsoGuard analysis.\n\nSponsor personnel will have open access to all Run-In phase data during the enrollment of the Run-In phase in order to determine if the data from patients enrolled to date is sufficient to inform adequately the setting of cutoffs. If Sponsor so determines, it may elect to terminate enrollment in the Run-In phase early (i.e., prior to enrolling the 100 Cases and 100 Controls listed above). If early termination of the Run-In phase is elected, all patients enrolled subsequent to the date Sponsor makes this election will be entered into the Efficacy phase and such subsequent patients will count towards the Efficacy phase enrollment objectives.\n\nAs well, should Sponsor complete the intended Run-In phase enrollment of 100 Cases and 100 Controls but determine, upon its assessment of the resulting data, that data from additional Cases could improve the setting of cutoffs, Sponsor may decide to enroll up to 100 additional Run-In phase Cases. These 100 Cases may be in whatever distribution of disease Sponsor elects (i.e., ranging from NDBE through to IMC). In order to augment the Run-In phase patient counts, the Sponsor will set updated targets for enrollment of each Run-In phase subgroup and will assign patients to each Run-In subgroup to be augmented, based on patients' Final Study Diagnosis and on whether the updated subgroup target has been met.

These trials established adjuvant radiotherapy following breast-conserving surgery as necessary to maximize local control, yet, in the intervening years, overall outcomes have improved significantly owing to widespread adoption of screening mammography, resulting in a substantial reduction in average tumor size at diagnosis, as well as improvements in surgical techniques and, crucial for this proposal, the development of highly active systemic therapies.\n\nBefore the development of HER2-targeted therapies, patients with HER2-driven localized breast cancer had among the highest rates of local recurrence. However, with improved identification of these patients and the advent of HER2-directed therapies, outcomes have improved significantly, and trials have sought to optimize treatment to reduce the morbidity of both local and systemic treatment. Among the most salient of these examples is the APT trial, a single-arm adjuvant study that enrolled 410 breast cancer patients with HER2+ tumors \u2264 3cm in size and negative axillary nodes, who received adjuvant systemic therapy with weekly paclitaxel and trastuzumab for 12 weeks (TH) followed by 9 months of trastuzumab monotherapy. In addition to demonstrating a very low incidence of distant recurrence, among those on the trial who underwent BCT (lumpectomy and radiation, n = 244), only 2 local recurrence (LR) events have been reported after 7 years of follow-up (7-year LR = 1.2%), representing among the most favorable local outcomes of any breast cancer cohort studied to date. Confirmatory results are forthcoming from the ATEMPT trial, which evaluated the antibody-drug conjugate T-DM1 (ado-trastuzumab emtansine) (n=383) vs the TH regimen from the APT trial (n = 114), thus far showing only 3 LRs in each arm with a median 3-years of follow-up. Importantly, per the current standard of care for HER2+ patients undergoing BCT, all patients presumably received adjuvant breast radiotherapy.\n\nThe balance of the BCT literature, including a landmark meta-analysis by the Early Breast Cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group, suggests that adjuvant radiotherapy approximately halves the risk of local recurrence following lumpectomy across all analyzable subgroups. While the relative benefit appears constant across subgroups, the absolute benefit of adjuvant radiotherapy varies with the underlying risk. Taking the favorable results of the APT trial (1.2% 7-year LR), if one presumes that omission of radiotherapy yields a doubling or tripling of local recurrence (based on the observed RR of 0.5 - 0.66 for those receiving radiotherapy across the preponderance of historical trials), this population might have manifested a LR rate of 2.4 - 3.6% with the omission of radiotherapy. That is to say, the hypothesis is that administration of RT to APT patients undergoing BCT may have reduced the 7-year absolute risk of LR by only 1.2-2.4%. Through the identification of patients who are at low risk of LR, it may be acceptable for such patients to forego radiation. This hypothesis will be studied by evaluating omission of radiotherapy among patients with pT1N0 disease at breast-conserving surgery who receive adjuvant HER2-directed therapy (trastuzumab/paclitaxel preferred, other options per protocol), or with clinical tumors \u2264 3 cm and clinically negative axillary nodes (cN0) who achieve a pathologic complete response (pCR; ypT0N0) following preoperative (neoadjuvant) administration of HER2-directed therapy (trastuzumab/paclitaxel preferred, other options per protocol). It is expcted that the 5-year LR rate for this population omitting radiotherapy will be 2% or less, and that omission of radiation will not have a measurable impact on regional and distant recurrences or overall survival.\n\nThe practice of breast radiation oncology has benefited immensely from practice-changing trials that have refined the application of adjuvant radiotherapy since the early surgical studies determined whole breast radiotherapy to be necessary following lumpectomy. There are now several favorable breast cancer subtypes in which patients routinely forego radiotherapy after trials demonstrating modest benefits in terms of local recurrence and no impact on distant recurrence or survival, such as among small, low grade luminal cancers in older women and \"good-risk\" DCIS. Therefore, this will study the omission of radiotherapy among a population of HER2+ breast cancer patients who are now appreciated to also have favorable risk, so as to similarly weigh the attendant inconveniences, cost and morbidity of radiotherapy in light of an established absolute benefit, which may prove to be modest.", "SUMMARY": "This Phase III trial compares the recurrence-free interval (RFI) among patients with early-stage, low risk HER2+ breast cancer who undergo breast conserving surgery and receive HER2-directed therapy, and are randomized to not receive adjuvant breast radiotherapy versus those who are randomized to receive adjuvant radiotherapy per the standard of care.", "STATUS": "RECRUITING", "PRIMARY_OUTCOMES": "[{'measure': 'recurrence-free interval (RFI)', 'description': 'Time to recurrence event or censoring', 'timeFrame': 'From randomization to first recurrence event or censoring for the duration of the trial, at 10.5 years'}]", "SECONDARY_OUTCOMES": "[{'measure': 'ipsilateral breast recurrence (IBR) for radiation omitting arm', 'description': 'Time to IBTR event or censoring', 'timeFrame': 'From randomization to first recurrence event or censoring for the duration of the trial , measured at year 7'}, {'measure': 'ipsilateral breast recurrence (IBR) by treatment arm', 'description': 'Time to ipsilateral breast recurrence (IBR) by treatment arm.', 'timeFrame': 'From randomization to first recurrence event or censoring for the duration of the trial at 10.5 years.'}, {'measure': 'local regional recurrence (LRR) by treatment arm', 'description': 'Time to local regional recurrence (LRR) by treatment arm.', 'timeFrame': 'From randomization to first recurrence event or censoring for the duration of the trial at 10.5 years.'}, {'measure': 'disease-free survival (DFS) by treatment arm.', 'description': 'To determine disease-free survival (DFS) by treatment arm.', 'timeFrame': 'From the time of randomization for the duration of the trial at 10.5 years.'}, {'measure': 'overall survival (OS) by treatment arm.', 'description': 'To determine overall survival (OS) by treatment arm.', 'timeFrame': 'From the time of randomization for the duration of the trial at 10.5 years.'}, {'measure': 'patient-reported breast pain by treatment arm using the Breast Cancer Treatment Outcome Scale (BCTOS)', 'description': 'To evaluate whether there is a difference in patient-reported breast pain in patients who do and do not receive breast radiation in cohort A and cohort B.

Cohort studies reveal the prevalence of depressive symptoms in testicular cancer exceeds the general population. In fact, the majority of young adult cancer survivors will experience impairing, distressing, and modifiable physical, behavioral, and psychosocial adverse outcomes that persist long after the completion of primary medical treatment. These include psychological distress, impairment in the navigation and pursuit of life goals, persistent side effects, elevated risk of secondary malignancies and chronic illness, and biobehavioral burden (e.g., enhanced inflammation, dysregulated stress hormones) which influence morbidity and disease-related vulnerabilities. However, few targeted, effective interventions exist to assist young survivors in re-negotiating life goals and regulating cancer-related emotions and none focus on reducing the burden of morbidity via biobehavioral mechanisms.\n\nYoung or \"emerging\" adulthood is a period marked by goal attainment. Chronic illness experienced as \"off time\" in the lifespan interrupts goal pursuits and threatens valued life directions. As young adults return to goal pursuits, re-entry to post-cancer life can be a critical point in the survivorship trajectory. Behavioral intervention at this time is well positioned to confer longer-term impact. Emergent from our group's preliminary research, we developed and pilot-tested Goal-focused Emotion-Regulation Therapy (GET) as a novel behavioral intervention to enhance self-regulation through improved goal navigation skills, improved sense of purpose, and better ability to regulate emotional responses in young adults with testicular cancer. GET is a promising candidate intervention to address the mechanisms likely complicating the resolution of cancer-related burden.\n\nResponsive the need for feasible, effective, and scalable interventions, we will randomly allocate 250 young adult (ages 18 -39) testicular cancer patients to 6 sessions of GET or ISL, and evaluate primary and secondary outcomes at baseline, post-treatment, 3-month follow-up, and 6-months follow-up. We predict that GET will be associated with superior distress outcomes and comparatively greater reductions in adverse biobehavioral indicators (dysregulated diurnal stress hormones, elevated systemic inflammation), and these advantages will be maintained at three- and six-months following intervention. The intervention will be delivered via an interactive video platform to enhance access. An additional exploratory aim focuses on potential epigenetic vulnerabilities, to understand how environmental influences (via DNA methylation) on genes implicated in stress reactivity and mood regulation are related to cancer adjustment and intervention response.\n\nThis study capitalizes on the study team's unique expertise in biobehavioral oncology and salivary bioscience to test a novel behavioral intervention for young adult survivors. It has potential to understand how to alter proximal behavioral, biological, and psychological factors that underscore long term adverse effects.", "SUMMARY": "This study is a randomized controlled biobehavioral efficacy trial designed to investigate the feasibility and acceptability of a novel intervention, Goal-focused Emotion-Regulation Therapy (GET) aimed at improving distress symptoms, emotion regulation, goal navigation skills, and stress-sensitive biomarkers in young adult testicular cancer patients.\n\nParticipants will be randomized to receive six sessions of GET or Individual Supportive Listening (ISL) delivered over eight weeks.

Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Giving chemotherapy with radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells.

Chemotherapy drugs, such as cisplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading.

Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab and ipilimumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Cabozantinib is in a class of medications called kinase inhibitors. It works by blocking the action of an abnormal protein that signals cancer cells to multiply.

Cobimetinib is used in patients whose cancer has a mutated (changed) form of a gene called BRAF. It is in a class of medications called kinase inhibitors. It works by blocking the action of an abnormal protein that signals cancer cells to multiply. This helps slow or stop the spread of cancer cells. Venetoclax is in a class of medications called B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) inhibitors. It may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking Bcl-2, a protein needed for cancer cell survival. The combination of ASTX727 and venetoclax may be more effective in reducing the cancer signs and symptoms in patients with CMML, or MDS/MPN with excess blasts.", "STATUS": "RECRUITING", "PRIMARY_OUTCOMES": "[{'measure': 'Complete response rate', 'description': \"The complete remission rate will be compared between two arms using Fisher's exact test.

They must either commit to continue abstinence from heterosexual intercourse or begin TWO acceptable methods of birth control, one highly effective method and one additional effective method AT THE SAME TIME, at least 4 weeks before therapy, while taking lenalidomide, during dose interruptions, and for 7 months after study treatment. If menstrual cycles are irregular, the pregnancy testing should occur every 2 weeks. Pregnancy testing and counseling should be performed if a patient misses her period or if there is any abnormality in her menstrual bleeding. Lenalidomide treatment must be discontinued during this evaluation.\n* Men who are sexually active with FCBP must agree to use a latex or synthetic condom while taking lenalidomide, during dose interruptions and for up to 4 weeks after discontinuing lenalidomide, even if they have undergone a successful vasectomy. Male patients taking lenalidomide must abstain from donating blood, semen, or sperm during study participation and for at least 4 weeks after discontinuation from lenalidomide.\n* Patients who are randomized to receive lenalidomide need to register into the mandatory Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (REMS) program and be willing and able to comply with the requirements of REMS.\n* Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document. Legally authorized representatives may sign and give informed consent on behalf of study participants.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients who are in urgent need for MM therapy (such as in the setting of acute kidney injury, or high disease burden concerning for impending organ failure) may begin study treatment immediately after receiving one cycle of bortezomib combination (e.g. bortezomib-dexamethasone or cyclophosphamide-bortezomib-dexamethasone) or one course of pulse dose dexamethasone 20-40mg once daily for four days. No washout period is required.\n* Patients who have not recovered from adverse events due to prior anti-cancer therapy (i.e., have residual toxicities \\> grade 1) with the exception of alopecia.\n* Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents.\n* History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to selinexor (KPT-330) or other agents used in study.\n* Concomitant medications: Supportive care therapies such as bone directed therapies (zoledronic acid, denosumab), intravenous immunoglobulin therapy (IVIG) and anti-viral agents are allowed and recommended as per standard of care (SOC). Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors and strong CYP3A4 inducers are prohibited, due to their respective increase or decrease in bortezomib exposure. If strong CYP3A4 inhibitors cannot be avoided, then patients will be monitored for signs of bortezomib toxicity and a dose reduction of bortezomib will be considered.\n* Patients with uncontrolled intercurrent illness or any other significant condition(s) that would make participation in this protocol unreasonably hazardous.\n* Pregnant women are excluded because this study involves an investigational drug that may cause genotoxic, teratogenic, and mutagenic effects on the developing fetus and newborn and drugs that have known genotoxic, teratogenic, or abortifacient effect.\n\n  * Because there is potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with the drugs used in this study, breastfeeding is not allowed during treatment for all drugs and for 2 months after last dose of bortezomib and 1 week after the last dose of selinexor.", "DESCRIPTION": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To compare deep response (complete response \\[CR\\] + stringent CR \\[sCR\\]) by the end of induction cycle 4 in newly diagnosed high-risk multiple myeloma patients (HR NDxMM), in both study arms.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To assess the minimal residual disease (MRD)-negativity (10\\^-5). II. To assess overall response rate (ORR), very good partial response (VGPR), and partial response (PR).\n\nIII. To assess progression-free survival (PFS) and duration of response (DOR).\n\nCORRELATIVE OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To identify differential gene expression signature that predicts response to selinexor through ribonucleic acid sequencing (RNAseq) and cell-free deoxyribonucleic acid (cfDNA) studies.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.\n\nARM I (Dara-SVD): Patients receive daratumumab and hyaluronidase-fihj subcutaneously (SC) on days 1, 8, 15, \\& 22 for cycles 1-2, then days 1 \\& 15 for cycles 3-4, and selinexor orally (PO), bortezomib SC, and dexamethasone PO on days 1, 8, 15, \\& 22 of each cycle. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 4 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also undergo positron emission tomography (PET), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or computed tomography (CT), and bone marrow biopsy and collection of blood samples during screening and at the end of treatment.\n\nARM II (Dara-RVD): Patients receive daratumumab and hyaluronidase-fihj SC on days 1, 8, 15, \\& 22 for cycles 1-2, then days 1 \\& 15 for cycles 3-4, lenalidomide PO once daily (QD) on days 1-21 of each cycle, and bortezomib SC and dexamethasone PO on days 1, 8, 15, \\& 22 of each cycle. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 4 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also undergo PET, MRI, or CT, and bone marrow biopsy and collection of blood samples during screening and at the end of treatment.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 6 months and 1 and 2 years.", "SUMMARY": "This phase II trial compares the combination of selinexor, daratumumab, Velcade (bortezomib), and dexamethasone (Dara-SVD) to the usual treatment of daratumumab, lenalidomide, bortezomib, and dexamethasone (Dara-RVD) in treating patients with high-risk newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. Selinexor is in a class of medications called selective inhibitors of nuclear export (SINE). It works by blocking a protein called CRM1, which may keep cancer cells from growing and may kill them. Daratumumab is in a class of medications called monoclonal antibodies. It binds to a protein called CD38, which is found on some types of immune cells and cancer cells, including myeloma cells. Daratumumab may block CD38 and help the immune system kill cancer cells. Bortezomib blocks several molecular pathways in a cell and may cause cancer cells to die. It is a type of proteasome inhibitor and a type of dipeptidyl boronic acid. Dexamethasone is in a class of medications called corticosteroids. It is used to reduce inflammation and lower the body's immune response to help lessen the side effects of chemotherapy drugs. Lenalidomide is in a class of medications called immunomodulatory agents. It works by helping the bone marrow to produce normal blood cells and by killing abnormal cells in the bone marrow. The drugs daratumumab, lenalidomide, bortezomib, dexamethasone and selinexor are already approved by the FDA for use in myeloma. But selinexor is not used until myeloma comes back (relapses) after initial treatment. Giving selinexor in the initial treatment may be a superior type of treatment for patients with high-risk newly diagnosed multiple myeloma.", "STATUS": "RECRUITING", "PRIMARY_OUTCOMES": "[{'measure': 'Deep clinical response', 'description': 'Defined as complete response (CR) + stringent CR.', 'timeFrame': 'Up to the end of cycle 4 (each cycle = 28 days)'}]", "SECONDARY_OUTCOMES": "[{'measure': 'Minimal residual disease-negativity (10^-5)', 'description': 'Will be assessed by next generation flow cytometry.', 'timeFrame': 'Up to end of cycle 4 (each cycle = 28 days)'}]", "OTHER_OUTCOMES": "[{'measure': 'Ribonucleic acid (RNA) and cell free deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequencing', 'description': 'Will compare pre- and post-treatment RNA and cell free DNA sequencing data to identify unique differential signature correlated with deep responses among subjects treated with selinexor-daratumumab-velcade-dexamethasone regimen.

and thereby modulate RBC metabolism by impacting two critical pathways in RBCs. The etavopivat clinical development program will investigate whether decreasing 2,3-DPG may help oxygen bind to hemoglobin (i.e. increasing oxygen affinity), and thereby increase ATP and impact RBC function. This study is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter Phase 2/3 study of patients age 12 to 65 years (inclusive), with sickle cell disease. There are two planned interim analyses in this study design. Initially, patients will be randomized at 1:1:1 to one of two dose levels of etavopivat or placebo. At the first interim analysis, one of the two etavopivat dose levels will be selected for the Phase 3 portion of the study, in which patients will be randomized at 1:1 to the selected etavopivat dose or placebo. Efficacy on hemoglobin will be evaluated at the second interim analysis, and then will be tested along with evaluation of efficacy on vaso-occlusive crises at the final analysis. Following completion of 52 weeks of double-blind treatment, patients may enter a 52-week etavopivat open-label extension period.", "SUMMARY": "This clinical trial is a Phase 2/3 study that will evaluate the efficacy and safety of etavopivat and test how well etavopivat works compared to placebo to improve the amount of hemoglobin in the blood and to reduce the number of vaso-occlusive crises (times when the blood vessels become blocked and cause pain).", "STATUS": "RECRUITING", "PRIMARY_OUTCOMES": "[{'measure': 'Hemoglobin response rate', 'description': 'Hemoglobin response rate at Week 24 (increase of \\\\> 1 g/dL \\\\[\\\\> 10 g/L\\\\] from baseline) during the blinded treatment period', 'timeFrame': '24 Weeks'}, {'measure': 'Annualized vaso-occlusive crisis', 'description': 'Annualized vaso-occlusive crisis rate during the 52-week blinded treatment period based on adjudicated vaso-occlusive crisis review', 'timeFrame': '52 Weeks'}]", "SECONDARY_OUTCOMES": "[{'measure': 'Hemoglobin', 'description': 'Change from baseline in hemoglobin at Week 24 during the blinded treatment period', 'timeFrame': '24 Weeks'}, {'measure': 'Hemoglobin', 'description': 'Change from baseline in hemoglobin at Week 52 during the blinded treatment period', 'timeFrame': '52 Weeks'}, {'measure': 'Absolute reticulocyte count', 'description': 'Change in absolute reticulocyte count from baseline at Week 24 during the blinded treatment period', 'timeFrame': '24 Weeks'}, {'measure': 'Unconjugated bilirubin', 'description': 'Change in unconjugated bilirubin from baseline at Week 24 during the blinded treatment period', 'timeFrame': '24 Weeks'}, {'measure': 'Lactate dehydrogenase', 'description': 'Change in lactate dehydrogenase from baseline at Week 24 during the blinded treatment period', 'timeFrame': '24 Weeks'}, {'measure': 'Vaso-occlusive crisis', 'description': 'Time to first vaso-occlusive crisis during the blinded treatment period', 'timeFrame': '52 Weeks'}, {'measure': 'Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS)', 'description': 'Change in PROMIS Fatigue Scale from baseline in adult patients at Week 24 during the blinded treatment period', 'timeFrame': '24 Weeks'}, {'measure': 'Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Fatigue Scale', 'description': 'Change in PROMIS Fatigue Scale from baseline in adult patients at Week 52 during the blinded treatment period', 'timeFrame': '52 Weeks'}]", "AGE_DESCRIPTION": "CHILD, ADULT, OLDER_ADULT", "CONDITIONS": ["Sickle Cell Disease", "Sickle Cell Disease", "Sickle Cell", "Anemia", "Sickle Cell Anemia", "Hemolytic", "Hemoglobin", "Vaso-occlusive Crisis", "Sickle Cell Crisis", "Congenital Anemia", "Hemolytic Anemia", "Hematologic Disease", "Hemoglobinopathies", "Genetic Disease", "Inborn Disease", "Sickle Cell Trait", "Pyruvate Kinase"], "OVERALL_OFFICIALS": "[{'name': 'Clinical Transparency (dept. 2834)', 'affiliation': 'Novo Nordisk A/S', 'role': 'STUDY_DIRECTOR'}, {'name': 'Zahra Pakbaz', 'affiliation': 'University Of California, Irvine'}]", "LOCATIONS": "[{'facility': 'Office of Gershwin T.

In the United States, common causes of viral pneumonia are SARS-CoV-2, influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and bacterial pneumonia are Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus).\n\nEmerging evidence indicates that the respiratory system mechanics of patients with typical ARDS, with or without COVID-19 are broadly similar in contrast to earlier reports that suggested COVID-19-associated ARDS has distinctive features. SOC for patients with ARDS remains limited with current interventions that focus primarily on supportive therapy, including fluid management strategies and further injury prevention via lung protective ventilation. Ventilation approaches remain the cornerstone in the treatment of ARDS and approaches to minimize ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) resulting from the imposition of stretch-trauma to the lung, continue to be a major focus of clinical importance. Several techniques may be utilized to accomplish this objective. Clinical guidelines strongly recommend volume-limited or pressure-limited ventilator approaches for patients with severe ARDS and high positive-end expiratory pressure strategies for patients with moderate to severe ARDS. Despite decades of improving supportive care, mortality remains high, ranging from 34.9% of patients with mild ARDS to 46.1% of patients with severe ARDS.\n\nWhatever the causative organism it is increasingly apparent that their impact on lung microvasculature is a major contributing factor to morbidity and mortality associated with those infections. Most deaths from influenza virus infections occur due to pulmonary complications, in particular the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), that is due to increased permeability of the lung microvasculature. Emerging evidence in COVID-19 infections suggest a similar pathophysiology where pulmonary endothelial cells and vascular dysfunction contribute to the initiation and propagation of ARDS by altering blood vessel integrity, promoting a pro-coagulative state, inducing endotheliitis and mediating inflammatory cell infiltration. Therefore, a therapeutic intervention that could modulate the course of pulmonary disease not by treating the causative organism but by reducing the deleterious inflammatory sequalae of those infections may have a significant positive impact\n\nAV-001 is a synthetic Angiopoietin-1 (Angpt-1) mimetic that has been shown to activate the Tie2 receptor tyrosine kinase; a transmembrane protein target most highly expressed on the surface of endothelial cells in the vasculature. The Tie2/Angiopoietin signaling axis has been identified as a nonredundant gatekeeper of vascular homeostasis. In healthy individuals, Tie2 is highly activated and signals the endothelium to fortify intracellular junctions and reduce expression of adhesion molecules, which serve as leukocyte tethers upon inflammation. As such, homeostatic activation results in the promotion of barrier defense against vascular leakage.\n\nA total of 120 eligible patients (20 patients each in cohorts 1, 2 and 3 and 60 patients in cohort 4) will be recruited from participating institutions / hospitals. Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either AV-001 Injection or AV-001 placebo Injection, together with SOC. All patients will receive supportive care according to the SOC for the trial site hospital likely to include remdesivir and or dexamethasone. Study drug will be administered by bolus IV injection (\\< 60 seconds). Doses of AV-001 Injection to be administered will start with the lowest proposed dose of 12.5 \u03bcg/kg/day in cohort 1 (DL1) and are anticipated to increase to 25 \u03bcg/kg/day in cohort 2 (DL2), 56 \u03bcg/kg/day in cohort 3 (DL3) and to be determined (TBD) based on recommendation from the DSMB for cohort 4 (DL4). The dose for cohort 4 will be chosen based on available safety and efficacy data obtained from all patients completing DL1, DL2 and DL3. DL4 may be an intermediate dose level, repeat of an earlier dose level (DL1, DL2, or DL3) or expansion of earlier dose level cohort (DL1, DL2, or DL3). Based on emerging data, a decision to enroll a fifth cohort (n=20 to increase the sample size to n=140) may also be made for the purpose of investigating an intermediate dose level, evaluating effects in patients with a different baseline Clinical Progression Scale (CPS) score or to provide comparative data regarding AV-001 Injection in patients with other respiratory viruses.\n\nThe study population for this Phase 2a study will consist of male and non-pregnant female patients, \u2265 18 years of age, hospitalized with presumed pneumonia secondary to SARS-CoV-2 or other viral or bacterial infection with acute onset to a respiratory compromise requiring supplemental oxygen therapy.", "SUMMARY": "A Phase 2a, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple ascending dose study in patients who are hospitalized with presumed pneumonia requiring supplemental oxygen therapy.

However, circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) shed into the bloodstream represents a highly specific and sensitive approach (especially with serial monitoring) for identifying microscopic or residual tumor cells in colon cancer patients and may outperform traditional clinical and pathological features in prognosticating risk for recurrence.

causes\n* History of atrial fibrillation/flutter, left ventricular thrombus, mechanic valve or other cardioembolic source of stroke requiring anticoagulation", "SUMMARY": "Researchers are looking for a better way to prevent an ischemic stroke which occurs when a blood clot travelled to the brain in people who within the last 72 hours had:\n\n* an acute stroke due to a blood clot that formed outside the heart (acute non-cardioembolic ischemic stroke), or\n* TIA/mini-stroke with a high risk of turning into a stroke (high-risk transient ischemic attack), and who are planned to receive standard of care therapy. Acute ischemic strokes or TIA/mini-stroke result from a blocked or reduced blood flow to a part of the brain. They are caused by blood clots that travel to the brain and block the vessels that supply it. If these blood clots form elsewhere than in the heart, the stroke is called non-cardioembolic. People who already had a non-cardioembolic stroke are more likely to have another stroke. This is why they are treated preventively with an antiplatelet therapy, the current standard of care. Antiplatelet medicines prevent platelets, components of blood clotting, from clumping together.\n\nAnticoagulants are another type of medicine that prevents blood clots from forming by interfering with a process known as coagulation (or blood clotting).\n\nThe study treatment asundexian is a new type of anticoagulant currently under development to provide further treatment options. Asundexian aims to further improve the standard of care without increasing the risk of bleeding.\n\nThe main purpose of this study is to learn whether asundexian works better than placebo at reducing ischemic strokes in participants who recently had a non-cardioembolic ischemic stroke or TIA/mini-stroke when given in addition to standard antiplatelet therapy. A placebo is a treatment that looks like a medicine but does not have any medicine in it.\n\nAnother aim is to compare the occurrence of major bleeding events during the study between the asundexian and the placebo group. Major bleedings have a serious or even life-threatening impact on a person's health.\n\nDependent on the treatment group, the participants will either take asundexian or placebo once a day for at least 3 months up to 31 months.\n\nApproximately every 3 months during the treatment period, either a phone call or a visit to the study site is scheduled on an alternating basis. In addition, one visit before and up to two visits after the treatment period are planned.\n\nDuring the study, the study team will:\n\n* Check vital signs such as blood pressure and heart rate\n* Examine the participants' heart health using an electrocardiogram (ECG)\n* Take blood samples\n* Ask the participants questions about how they are feeling and what adverse events they are having.\n\nAn adverse event is any medical problem that a participant has during a study. Doctors keep track of all adverse events that happen in studies, even if they do not think the adverse events might be related to the study treatments. In addition, the participants will be asked to complete a questionnaire on quality of life at certain time points during the study.", "STATUS": "RECRUITING", "PRIMARY_OUTCOMES": "[{'measure': 'Time to first occurrence of ischemic stroke', 'timeFrame': 'Up to 31 months'}, {'measure': 'Time to first occurrence of ISTH major bleeding', 'description': 'ISTH=International Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis', 'timeFrame': 'Up to 31 months'}]", "SECONDARY_OUTCOMES": "[{'measure': 'Time to first occurrence of all strokes (ischemic and hemorrhagic)', 'timeFrame': 'Up to 31 months'}, {'measure': 'Time to first occurrence of composite of CV death, MI or stroke', 'description': 'CV=Cardiovascular, MI=Myocardial infarction', 'timeFrame': 'Up to 31 months'}, {'measure': 'Time to first occurrence of composite of all-cause mortality, MI or stroke', 'timeFrame': 'Up to 31 months'}, {'measure': 'Time to first occurrence of disabling stroke (mRS \u22653 at 90 days)', 'description': 'mRS=Modified Rankin Scale', 'timeFrame': 'Up to 31 months'}, {'measure': 'Time to first occurrence of all-cause mortality', 'timeFrame': 'Up to 31 months'}, {'measure': 'Time to first occurrence of transient ischemic attack (TIA)', 'timeFrame': 'Up to 31 months'}, {'measure': 'Time to first occurrence of composite of ISTH major or clinically relevant non-major bleeding', 'timeFrame': 'Up to 31 months'}, {'measure': 'Time to first occurrence of ISTH clinically relevant non-major bleeding', 'timeFrame': 'Up to 31 months'}, {'measure': 'Time to first occurrence of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage', 'timeFrame': 'Up to 31 months'}, {'measure': 'Time to first occurrence of hemorrhagic stroke', 'timeFrame': 'Up to 31 months'}, {'measure': 'Time to first occurrence of fatal bleeding', 'timeFrame': 'Up to 31 months'}, {'measure': 'Time to first occurrence of minor bleeding', 'timeFrame': 'Up to 31 months'}, {'measure': 'Time to first occurrence of composite of ischemic stroke or ISTH major bleeding', 'timeFrame': 'Up to 31 months'}, {'measure': 'Time to first occurrence of composite of CV death, all stroke, MI or ISTH major bleeding', 'timeFrame': 'Up to 31 months'}, {'measure': 'Time to first occurrence of composite of all-cause mortality, disabling stroke, fatal bleeding, symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage', 'timeFrame': 'Up to 31 months'}, {'measure': 'Time to first occurrence of ischemic stroke in the first 90 days', 'timeFrame': 'Up to 31 months'}]", "AGE_DESCRIPTION": "ADULT, OLDER_ADULT", "CONDITIONS": ["Prevention of Ischemic Stroke", "Acute Non-cardioembolic Ischemic Stroke", "High-risk Transient Ischemic Attack"], "LOCATIONS": "[{'facility': 'Cottage Health | Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital -

The main focus of this trial is a platform study for identifying effective agents for the treatment of COVID-19. Any critically ill patient with known or presumed COVID-19 will be automatically entered into the screening phase of the trial until SARS-CoV-2 infection is confirmed. Basic data will be assembled for each patient (such as ventilatory status and survival). If interested in the therapeutic portion of the trial, potential participants will be asked to sign a consent form describing the backbone treatment and the two specific investigational agent arms to which they may be randomized. The primary endpoints will be time to recover to a durable level 4 (or less) on the WHO COVID-19 ordinal scale for clinical improvement and time to mortality (death). For this trial, a durable level 4 is defined as at least 48 hours at COVID level 4 or less (nasal prongs oxygen) without returning to high flow oxygen or intubation. Acute care facility resource utilization will be automatically calculated (total length of stay in a critical care setting, days intubated, and survival). Any change in status, including intubation, extubation, death or discharge, will be recorded and verified by the attending physician.\n\nPatients will be evaluated based on their initial status (ventilation at entry vs. high flow oxygen). Exploratory biomarkers will be evaluated over time (ARDS phenotypes and other proposed markers) to facilitate clinical learning. A maximum of two investigational arms may be open at a time. The anticipated accrual will be 50 patients per week. The maximum number of participants assigned to an arm without graduation will be 125 patients. Agents can be dropped for futility after enrollment of 40 patients. As the trial proceeds and a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of the COVID-19 illness emerges, expanded biomarker and data collection can be added as needed to further elucidate how agents are or are not working. The study design features comparison of investigational agent efficacy using a Bayesian design, which will allow the detection of strong efficacy signals with the fewest possible patients. Initially the control will be patients given current standard of care (supportive care for ARDS, including lung protective ventilation and remdesivir and dexamethasone as backbone therapy). As other treatments (for example, anticoagulation) become part of standard supportive care across sites, these will be added to the backbone therapy. If an agent meets the threshold for graduation the company leadership will be informed as will the FDA. The arm with the graduated agent will cease to enroll, allowing a new arm with a different investigational agent to be added.\n\nEvery trial participant will have blood collected at trial enrollment, day 3, and day 7 for pre-specified biomarker and DNA and RNA analysis. Additional biomarkers can be added as the trial proceeds. Patient outcomes will also be evaluated on the basis of whether patients are ventilated initially or not.\n\nObservational Component:\n\nInitially, all COVID-19 confirmed patients who started high-flow oxygen (WHO COVID-19 level 5; \u22656L oxygen by nasal prongs or mask) were entered in an Observational Component which collected data via extraction of medical records. Patients in this Observational Component also had their daily COVID status and drug administration form CRFs completed. An expanded Observational Study will replace the original Observational Component. The expanded observational study (Supplement 1) will collect blood sample(s) and clinical data from ARDS and AHRF patients (including COVID ARDS patients) to test the feasibility of quantifying a set of biomarkers that will allow each patient to be classified into either a hyper-inflammatory or hypo-inflammatory subtype in real time. If treatment of these critically ill ICU patients is to be guided by subtype classification, it is essential that the operational time for classification is as quick as possible.", "SUMMARY": "The goal of this project is to rapidly screen promising agents, in the setting of an adaptive platform trial, for treatment of critically ill COVID-19 patients.

To determine the overall survival of patients receiving neoadjuvant therapy prior to curative intent surgical resection. (Efficacy) V. To determine the relapse free survival (RFS) of patients receiving neoadjuvant therapy prior to curative intent surgical resection. (Efficacy) VI.

Durvalumab is a monoclonal antibody that may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Chemotherapy drugs, such as gemcitabine and cisplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving durvalumab with gemcitabine and cisplatin before surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed in patients with high risk resectable cholangiocarcinoma.", "STATUS": "RECRUITING", "PRIMARY_OUTCOMES": "[{'measure': 'Proportion of patients who complete 4 cycles of neoadjuvant therapy followed by surgical resection', 'description': 'Descriptive analysis will be used.

Determine whether obesity or overweight status, as measured by body mass index, at diagnosis increases the risk of hepatic dysfunction.\n2. Quantify the disease response, based on the end of Induction minimal residual disease (MRD) in the bone marrow of patients receiving levocarnitine, compared to historical controls to determine that levocarnitine does not have a negative impact on MRD.\n3.

The necessary chemotherapy for pediatric and adolescent and young adult (AYA) patients with ALL includes steroids, anthracyclines, asparaginase, and vincristine. One of the most hepatotoxic chemotherapy agents is asparaginase, with treatment-associated hepatotoxicity (TAH) observed in up to 60% of patients. The frequency of TAH is increased in overweight or obese patients of Latino heritage. Carnitine is a naturally-derived compound that is produced in the liver and kidneys; it is found in certain foods, such as meat, poultry, fish, and some dairy products. Endogenous carnitine transports long-chain fatty acids into the mitochondria, where they are oxidized to produce energy, and acts as scavengers of oxygen free radicals. Thus, carnitine can reduce oxidative stress and modulate inflammatory response. Levocarnitine is a supplement form of carnitine used typically in the care and management of patients with carnitine deficiency. Pediatric and AYAs with ALL will be given oral levocarnitine as a supplement during their initial phases of treatment, when the most hepatotoxic agents are administered, to determine if the incidence of liver toxicity can be reduced or eliminated.", "STATUS": "RECRUITING", "PRIMARY_OUTCOMES": "[{'measure': 'Primary Outcome #1', 'description': 'Calculate proportion of patients who experience hepatotoxicity, as measured by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0 grade \u2265 3 elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and total and direct bilirubin.', 'timeFrame': '1.5 years'}, {'measure': 'Primary Outcome #2', 'description': 'Calculate prevalence of hepatotoxicity in patients who self-identify as Latino or non-Latino, using laboratory assessments and self-reported measures of ethnicity and/or race.', 'timeFrame': '1.5 years'}]", "SECONDARY_OUTCOMES": "[{'measure': 'Secondary Outcome #1', 'description': 'Calculate body mass index (BMI), from recorded height and weight obtained at time of initial diagnosis and determine if there is increased risk of hepatotoxicity in patients who are overweight or obese at diagnosis as determined by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) clinical growth charts for study participants 5 to \\\\< 20 years of age and by a BMI of \u2265 25.0 for study participants 20 to \\\\< 30 years of age.', 'timeFrame': '1.5 years'}, {'measure': 'Secondary Outcome #2', 'description': 'Quantify disease response, using end of Induction minimal residual disease (MRD) results, where an MRD value \\\\< 0.01 is considered \"negative.\"', 'timeFrame': '1.5 years'}, {'measure': 'Secondary Outcome #3', 'description': 'Calculate incidence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), using ultrasound elastography, in pediatric and AYA patients newly diagnosed with ALL.', 'timeFrame': '1.5 years'}, {'measure': 'Secondary Outcome #4', 'description': 'Calculate proportion of patients who experience other known toxicities of asparaginase treatment, as measured by CTCAE version 5.0 grade \u2265 3 hyper/hypoglycemia, hypertriglyceridemia, pancreatitis, and thrombosis.', 'timeFrame': '1.5 years'}]", "AGE_DESCRIPTION": "CHILD, ADULT", "CONDITIONS": ["Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia", "Hepatotoxicity"], "LOCATIONS": "[{'facility': \"Children's Hospital of Orange County\", 'city': 'Orange', 'state': 'California', 'country': 'United States'}, {'facility': \"Children's Hospital of Orange County\", 'city': 'Orange', 'state': 'California', 'country': 'United States'}]", "RARE_DISEASE": "Y", "MANAGEMENT_GROUPS": ["CFCCC Clinical Trials Unit (primary)", "CFCCC Clinical Trials Unit Team B", "CFCCC Review and Regulatory Unit"], "DISEASE_SITES": ["Lymphoid Leukemia"], "TREATMENT_TYPE_DESC": "Supportive Care", "PHASE_DESC": "N/A", "SCOPE_DESC": "Local", "OVERALL_OFFICIALS": "[{'name': 'Deepa Jeyakumar', 'affiliation': 'University Of California, Irvine'}]"}, {"NCT_ID": "NCT04708782", "TITLE": "A Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled, Phase 3 Study of the Efficacy and Safety of Inhaled Treprostinil in Subjects With Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis", "ORGANIZATION": "{'fullName': 'United Therapeutics', 'class': 'INDUSTRY'}", "SHORT_TITLE": "Study of Efficacy and Safety of Inhaled Treprostinil in Subjects With Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis", "SPONSOR": "['United Therapeutics']", "DETAILED_ELIGIBILITY": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.

The study is designed to be able to prove or disprove that there is no difference in risk of the tumour recurring around the scar or anywhere else in the body between the two groups of patients. If the study shows no risk of tumour recurrence then we will also be able to determine how much of an impact the narrower excision has on patients in terms of improved quality of life and reduced side effects from the surgery and melanoma disease. This trial will also evaluate and determine the economic impact of narrower excision margins on the health services and society in general.", "SUMMARY": "Patients with a primary invasive melanoma are recommended to undergo excision of the primary lesion with a wide margin. There is evidence that less radical margins of excision may be just as safe. This is a randomised controlled trial of 1 cm versus 2 cm margin of excision of the primary lesion for adult patients with stage II primary invasive cutaneous melanomas (AJCC 8th edition) to determine differences in disease-free survival.

AA usually affects the head and face, but hair loss can happen on any part of the body. The purpose of this study is to assess how safe, effective, and tolerable upadacitinib is in adolescent and adult participants with severe AA.\n\nUpadacitinib is an approved drug being investigated for the treatment of AA. In Study 1 and Study 2 Period A, participants are placed in 1 of 3 groups, called treatment arms. Each group receives a different treatment. There is a 1 in 5 chance that participants will be assigned to placebo. In Study 1 and Study 2 Period B, participants originally randomized to upadacitinib dose group in Period A will continue their same treatment in Period B. Participants originally randomized to Placebo in Period A will either remain on placebo in Period B, or be randomized in 1 of 2 groups, based off of their Severity of Alopecia Tool (SALT) score. Participants who complete Study 1 or Study 2, can join Study 3 and may be re-randomized to receive 1 of 2 doses of upadacitinib for up to 108 weeks. Around 1500 participants with severe AA will be enrolled in the study at approximately 240 sites worldwide.\n\nParticipants will receive oral tablets of either upadacitinib or placebo once daily for up to 160 weeks with the potential of being re-randomized into a different treatment group at Weeks 24 and 52. Participants will be followed up for up to 30 days after last study drug dose.\n\nThere may be higher treatment burden for participants in this trial compared to their standard of care. Participants will attend regular visits during the study at a hospital or clinic.

Pembrolizumab can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman based on the biological mechanism that PD-1/PD-L1 signaling is an important pathway in the maintenance of pregnancy through induction of maternal immune tolerance to fetal tissue.1 Human IgG4 is known to cross the placenta. Animal models have found that blocking PD-L1 signaling increases the risk of fetal loss, and immune-mediated disorders occurred in PD-1 knockout mice.\n  2. Although there are not data on the presence of pembrolizumab in either animal or human milk or its effects on breastfed children or on milk production, there is a potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed children.

About 40% of pregnant women in the United States are nulliparas. Because little or no information from previous pregnancy outcomes is available to guide assignment of risk or mitigating interventions, adverse pregnancy outcomes in nulliparas are especially unpredictable. The underlying mechanisms of adverse pregnancy outcomes such as preterm birth, preeclampsia, fetal growth restriction and stillbirth are interrelated and therefore will be evaluated as part of this study. The information gained will benefit women who are pregnant or who are considering pregnancy and their physicians. In addition, the knowledge will support future research aimed at improving care and health outcomes for a critical group of at-risk women who are currently understudied.\n\nThe study is a prospective cohort study of a racially/ethnically/geographically diverse population of 10,038 nulliparous women with singleton gestations. The women undergo intensive research assessments during the course of their pregnancies to study the mechanisms for and prediction of adverse pregnancy outcomes (APOs) in women in their first pregnancy. The APOs of primary interest are preterm birth, preeclampsia and fetal growth restriction.\n\nThe goals of the study are to 1) determine maternal characteristics, including genetics, epigenetics, and physiological response to pregnancy as well as environmental factors that influence and/or predict adverse pregnancy outcome; 2) identify specific aspects of placental development and function that lead to adverse pregnancy outcome; and 3) characterize genetic, growth, and developmental parameters of the fetus that are associated with adverse pregnancy outcome.\n\nEight academic medical centers or sites had primary responsibility for enrollment and follow-up of study participants. Several of these sites collected data through additional academic research centers or nearby hospitals (subsites). A Data Coordinating and Analysis Center (DCAC) provided input to the protocol, manages the data, and analyzes the data. Investigators from these institutions have established a partnership with NICHD staff to develop and implement the study protocol and ancillary studies that acquire and analyze data to identify biomarkers and understand the mechanism and prediction of preterm birth and other adverse pregnancy outcomes.\n\nNulliparous women with an in utero singleton gestation between 6 weeks 0 days and 13 weeks 6 days of pregnancy were recruited through the eight clinical sites and their subsites. Mechanisms were created in the various prenatal clinics associated with the sites to identify eligible nulliparous women with singleton pregnancies. Once enrolled, a participant was followed for the duration of her pregnancy by research staff at the clinical site. Study visits were scheduled at four times during the pregnancy: 6 weeks 0 days through 13 weeks 6 days estimated gestational age (EGA), 16 weeks 0 days through 21 weeks 6 days EGA, 22 weeks 0 days through 29 weeks 6 days EGA, and at the time of delivery. Data were collected through personal interview, self-administered questionnaires, clinical measurement, chart abstraction, and collection of biological specimens (blood, urine, cervico-vaginal fluid). Additional data (i.e., sleep breathing assessments, actigraphy, fetal adrenal gland measurements) were collected through ancillary research studies on subsets of the enrolled women. The set-ups for screening, enrollment and follow-up of participants varied by clinical site and subsite. However, in each setting, the clinical site staffs included study investigators, research nurses, research assistants and sonographers. Clinical site staffs were trained to interview participants, collect and process samples, conduct various research tests, and input data. Data are managed at the DCAC. Specimens are stored at the NICHD specimen repository for later analysis.", "SUMMARY": "Forty percent of pregnant women in the United States are women who have never given birth. As a group, they sometimes have complications with their pregnancy, but there is no information from a previous pregnancy to identify who might have a problem. Very little research has been done with this group. The Nulliparous Pregnancy Outcomes Study: Monitoring Mothers-to-be (nuMoM2b) is collecting data from a diverse population of about 10,000 women who are having their first baby and are carrying only one baby. The women are enrolled early in pregnancy and undergo research assessments four times during their pregnancies. Data are collected through interviews, self-completed data forms, clinical measurements, ultrasound, and collection and storage of blood samples, urine samples, and fluid from the vagina and cervix. Some information comes from medical records. A subset of women may be asked to participate in substudies collecting information on sleep breathing, sleep patterns and quality, or other areas possibly related to birth outcomes. The goal of the research is to find ways to identify women in this group who might develop a problem with their pregnancy and use this information to improve the health of pregnant women and their babies in the future.

Female subjects who are pregnant", "DESCRIPTION": "Purpose:\n\nOpioid antagonists at ultra-low doses have been used with opioid agonists to prevent or limit opioid tolerance. Remifentanil, a rapid onset/offset opioid that is often used as an anesthesia adjunct intraoperatively, has been associated with the development of hyperalgesia and opioid tolerance postoperatively. Opioid-induced hyperalgesia (OIH) induced by remifentanil intraoperatively may be a factor contributing to an increase in postoperative pain as well as difficulty in controlling such pain. The purpose of this study will be to evaluate whether an ultra-low dose of naloxone, an opioid antagonist, could block remifentanil-induced hyperalgesia and tolerance following surgery.\n\nThis research will help elucidate the degree of OIH after surgeries involving remifentanil and determine if a new technique can be employed to decrease remifentanil-induced OIH. By mitigating OIH, patients should have a decrease in postoperative pain and an increase in patient satisfaction at UCI and other hospitals where such a technique is employed.\n\nThere are 3 study groups: (1) low dose remifentanil (LO, 0.1 micrograms/kg/mL), (2) high dose remifentanil (0.4 mg) combined with placebo (HI, 0.4 micrograms/kg/mL), or (3) high dose remifentanil (0.4 mg) combined with ultra-low dose naloxone (HN, 0.004 micrograms/kg/mL naloxone).\n\nBackground:\n\nOpioid-induced hyperalgesia is a paradoxical increase in pain sensitivity following opioid exposure. The mechanism for this is likely due to an alteration in opioid receptor signaling with disruption of G-protein coupling and opioid-induced activation and hypertrophy of spinal glial cells (gliosis). Opioid-induced hyperalgesia has been noted with many different opioids, and the most well documented hyperalgesic effect is with remifentanil.\n\nVarious agents have been used in an attempt to reduce the development hyperalgesia following remifentanil. While there are few reports on the effect of ultra-low dose naloxone on opioid-induced hyperalgesia, recent evidence is emerging regarding its use in pain management. Ultra-low dose naloxone has been shown to prevent remifentanil-induced pain hypersensitivities (allodynia and hyperalgesia) in rats. However, there are little to no studies on reducing the adverse effects of remifentanil with naloxone in human subjects.\n\nExisting knowledge and previous research:\n\nAttempts have been made with various agents to reduce the development of tolerance and hyperalgesia following remifentanil. Postoperative hyperalgesia and its prevention has been studied with ketamine , Magnesium , Gabapentin, Clonidine, Lornoxicam , Dextromethorphan , Paracetamol , Morphine , Dexmedetomidine , Adenosine, COX inhibitors , Amantadine , Nitrous oxide, Fentanyl, Pregabalin , Buprenorphine, Midazolam, Dexamethasone. Relevant to our current hypothesis is the report that concomitant administration of ultra-low dose naloxone and naltrexone with remifentanil prevented OIH. However, there are no studies on reducing the adverse effects of remifentanil with ultra-low dose naloxone in human subjects.\n\nWhile the traditional role of opiate antagonists have been in cases of opioid overmedication, recent evidence is emerging regarding their use in pain management. Gan et al. 1997 used an ultra-low dose naloxone infusion (0.00025 mg/kg/h or 0.001 mg/kg/h) in postoperative patients receiving IV morphine via a patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) device. Good pain relief was experienced in all groups, however consumption of PCA morphine was significantly reduced in patients that received the lowest infusion of naloxone and opioid-induced side effects (nausea, vomiting, pruritus) were reduced by naloxone at both dose.\n\nNaloxone and/or naltrexone at ultra-low doses may enhance the analgesic effects of opioids, enhance the antinociceptive effects of methadone, and decrease or block the development of opioid tolerance in rodents. The combination of oxycodone with an ultra-low dose of the antagonist naltrexone as a singular oral medication, Oxytrex, has been developed to prevent the development of tolerance in the treatment of moderate to severe chronic pain.\n\nAguado et. al. 2013 recently evaluated the effects of the opioid antagonist, naloxone, on remifentanil-induced tolerance or hyperalgesia in rats. Hyperalgesia was considered to be a decrease in mechanical nociceptive thresholds (von Frey), while opioid tolerance was considered to be a decrease in sevoflurane MAC reduction by remifentanil. An ultra-low dose of naloxone was able to block remifentanil-induced hyperalgesia and the MAC increase associated with hyperalgesia, but did not change opioid tolerance under inhaled anesthesia.", "SUMMARY": "The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether using ultra-low dose naloxone, an opioid antagonist, has the potential to block remifentanil-induced hyperalgesia and tolerance following surgery.\n\nThere are 3 study groups: (1) low dose remifentanil (LO, 0.1 micrograms/kg/mL), (2) high dose remifentanil (0.4 mg) combined with placebo (HI, 0.4 micrograms/kg/mL), or (3) high dose remifentanil (0.4 mg) combined with ultra-low dose naloxone (HN, 0.004 micrograms/kg/mL naloxone).\n\nThe hypothesis of the study is that occurrence of remifentanil-induced hyperalgesia (low score in mechanical pain threshold) in the HN group will be lower than in the HI group.", "STATUS": "RECRUITING", "PRIMARY_OUTCOMES": "[{'measure': 'Occurrence of Opioid-induced hyperalgesia (OIH)', 'description': 'Mechanical Pain Threshold-determined by von Frey filaments around the incision site', 'timeFrame': '24 hr Post-surgery'}, {'measure': 'Occurrence of Opioid-induced hyperalgesia (OIH)', 'description': 'Mechanical Pain Threshold-determined by von Frey filaments around the incision site', 'timeFrame': '48 hr Post-surgery'}]", "SECONDARY_OUTCOMES": "[{'measure': 'Opioid consumption', 'description': 'Opioid consumption required to control pain by Oral morphine equivalents', 'timeFrame': '24 hr post surgery'}, {'measure': 'Opioid consumption', 'description': 'Opioid consumption required to control pain by Oral morphine equivalents', 'timeFrame': '48 hrs post surgery'}, {'measure': 'Cold Pressure Test', 'description': 'Pain Threshold and Pain tolerance', 'timeFrame': '24 hr post surgery'}, {'measure': 'Cold Pressure Test', 'description': 'Pain Threshold and Pain tolerance', 'timeFrame': '48 hrs post surgery'}, {'measure': 'Visual Analog Scale (VAS) Pain scores', 'description': 'VAS pain scores measured prior to surgery and at 4, 8 and 12h after extubation and again at 24h and 48h post-operatively', 'timeFrame': 'Baseline'}, {'measure': 'McGill short form questionnaire', 'description': 'The McGill questionnaire provides an assessment of pain quality and descriptors', 'timeFrame': 'Baseline'}, {'measure': 'Brief Pain Inventory', 'description': 'Brief Pain Inventory assesses both pain intensity and pain unpleasantness (the emotional component of pain is considered to be a better metric of subject satisfaction and quality of life).', 'timeFrame': 'Baseline'}]", "AGE_DESCRIPTION": "ADULT, OLDER_ADULT", "CONDITIONS": ["Hyperalgesia"], "OVERALL_OFFICIALS": "[{'name': 'Ariana Nelson, MD', 'affiliation': 'Associate Clinical Professor', 'role': 'PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR'}, {'name': 'Ariana Nelson', 'affiliation': 'University Of California, Irvine'}]", "LOCATIONS": "[{'facility': 'UC Irvine Medical Center', 'city': 'Orange', 'state': 'California', 'country': 'United States'}]", "RARE_DISEASE": "U", "MANAGEMENT_GROUPS": ["Anesthesiology & Perioperative Care (primary)"], "DISEASE_SITES": ["Anesthesia", "Hyperalgesia"], "TREATMENT_TYPE_DESC": "INT - Drug", "PHASE_DESC": "II", "SCOPE_DESC": ""}, {"NCT_ID": "NCT06453460", "TITLE": "Prospective Evaluation of Efficacy of CMV-specific T Cell Immunity (CMV-TCIP) Directed Letermovir Prophylaxis After Allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation", "ORGANIZATION": "{'fullName': 'University of California, Irvine', 'class': 'OTHER'}", "SHORT_TITLE": "Prospect Eval of Efficacy of CMV-TCIP Direct Letermovir Prophylax After Allogen Hemato Cell Transpla", "SPONSOR": "['Eurofins-Viracor', 'UCI']", "DETAILED_ELIGIBILITY": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* \u2265 18 years of age on the day of signing informed consent.\n* Karnofsky performance \\>70%\n* Have documented seropositivity for CMV (either donor or recipient CMV IgG seropositivity) before AHCT.\n* Eligible for AHCT from an HLA-matched related, matched unrelated, mismatched unrelated or haploidentical donor using either bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cells.\n* Have undetectable CMV DNA from a plasma sample collected within 5 days prior to enrollment.\n* Be within 28 days post-HSCT at the time of enrollment.\n* Be able to comply with medical recommendations or follow-up.\n* Has adequate organ functions determined by\n\n  1.

In addition, pre-clinical results demonstrated that BXQ-350 induced neurite generation and protection in vitro in the PC-12 and NS20Y cell lines and significantly decreased oxaliplatin-induced cold allodynia in a model of CIPN. Thus BXQ-350 may represent a new approach to deliver a neuropathy benefit.\n\nThe unique combination of BXQ-350 along with its proven safety profile, potential efficacy, and possible neuropathy benefit makes BXQ-350 a worthwhile candidate to use in combination with standard of care treatment for mCRC to not only enhance the standard treatment of mCRC, but also to evaluate its ability to alleviate side effects related to oxaliplatin-induced sensory neurotoxicity.", "SUMMARY": "The study will assess the safety and efficacy of BXQ-350 plus modified FOLFOX7 (mFOLFOX7) and bevacizumab in participants who have newly diagnosed metastatic adenocarcinoma of the colon/rectum.

Therefore, chemotherapy is less suitable to treat AML in people with the changed FLT3 gene.\n\nGilteritinib, given with venetoclax and azacitidine, is a potential new treatment for people with AML with the changed FLT3 gene. They cannot have chemotherapy due to old age or other conditions.

In this study, they do this to find a suitable dose for venetoclax and to check for potential medical problems from the treatment.\n\nIn this study, people newly diagnosed with AML who have the changed FLT3 gene and cannot have chemotherapy can take part.\n\nThe main aims of this study are: to find suitable doses of gilteritinib, venetoclax and azacitidine as a combined treatment; to learn how they are processed by and act upon the body; to learn the remission rate; to check for medical problems during this treatment.\n\nIn the study, people will visit the study clinic many times. The first visit is to check if they can take part. People will be asked about their medical history, have a medical examination, and have their vital signs checked. Also, they will have an ECG to check their heart rhythm and have some blood and urine samples taken for laboratory tests. They will have a chest X-ray and a bone marrow sample will be taken. The changed FLT3 gene will be confirmed, either by the bone marrow or a blood sample.\n\nThis study will be in 2 phases.\n\nIn Phase 1, different small groups of people will take venetoclax tablets containing lower to higher doses in the combined treatment. The doses of gilteritinib and azacytidine will be unchanged. This is done to find a suitable dose of venetoclax to use in phase 2 of the study. People will take tablets of gilteritinib and venetoclax once a day on a 28-day cycle. They will be given azacytidine as an infusion or an injection just under the skin.

They will be treated with the suitable doses of the combined treatment worked out from Phase 1. Treatment will be on a 28-day cycle. People will continue on cycles of treatment throughout this phase of the study.\n\nResearchers will work out the remission rate from this phase of the study. In each phase of the study, people can continue with up to 12 cycles of treatment if they can manage any medical problems. People will visit the study clinic many times during their first treatment cycle, and less often during the next cycles. During these visits, medical problems will be recorded and some blood samples will be taken for laboratory tests. On some visits, people will also have their vital signs checked. Bone marrow samples will be taken during cycle 1, and at the beginning of cycle 3. More samples will be taken during the study from people who are not in remission.\n\nWhen people have finished treatment, those who have responded well to treatment and are in remission will be invited to continue with up to 24 more cycles of gilteritinib plus azacitidine.\n\nAll people taking part in the study will visit the study clinic for an end-of-treatment visit. During this visit, medical problems will be recorded and some blood samples will be taken for laboratory tests. People will have a medical examination, an ECG, and will have their vital signs checked. Also, a bone marrow sample will be taken. There will be a follow-up visit 30 days later to check for medical problems. Then people will visit the clinic or get a phone call every 3 months for up to 3 years. This is to give an update on their current treatment for AML.\n\nSome people can have a stem cell transplant during the study if they meet certain study rules.

A solid tumor is one that starts in part of your body like your lungs or liver instead of your blood. Once they've grown bigger in one spot or spread to other parts of the body, they're harder to treat. This is called advanced or metastatic cancer.\n\nParticipants in this study must have breast cancer or gastric cancer. Participants must have tumors that have HER2 on them. This allows the cancer to grow more quickly or spread faster. There are few treatment options for patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors that express HER2.\n\nThis clinical trial uses an experimental drug called disitamab vedotin (DV). Disitamab vedotin is a type of antibody drug conjugate or ADC. ADCs are designed to stick to cancer cells and kill them.\n\nThis clinical trial uses a drug called tucatinib, which has been approved to treat cancer in the United States and some other countries. This drug is sold under the brand name TUKYSA\u00ae.\n\nThis study will test how safe and how well DV, with or without tucatinib, is for participants with solid tumors.

Mosunetuzumab is a monoclonal antibody that may interfere with the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Polatuzumab vedotin is a monoclonal antibody, called polatuzumab, linked to a drug called vedotin. Polatuzumab is a form of targeted therapy because it attaches to specific molecules (receptors) on the surface of cancer cells, and delivers vedotin to kill them. Chemotherapy drugs, such as fludarabine and cyclophosphamide, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. CAR T-cell therapy is a type of treatment in which a patient's T cells (a type of immune system cell) are changed in the laboratory so they will attack cancer cells. T cells are taken from a patient's blood. Then the gene for a special receptor that binds to a certain protein on the patient's cancer cells is added to the T cells in the laboratory.

Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as atezolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Bevacizumab is in a class of medications called antiangiogenic agents. It works by stopping the formation of blood vessels that bring oxygen and nutrients to tumor. This may slow the growth and spread of tumor. Cetuximab is in a class of medications called monoclonal antibodies. It binds to a protein called EGFR, which is found on some types of cancer cells. This may help keep cancer cells from growing. Cisplatin and carboplatin are in a class of chemotherapy medications known as platinum-containing compounds. They work by killing, stopping, or slowing the growth of cancer cells. Docetaxel is in a class of chemotherapy medications called taxanes.

We have reliable, well-validated Spanish tests for all outcome measures.\n* Participants without a known history of diabetes. If diabetes is diagnosed during screening (hemoglobin A1c of 6.5 % or greater) they will also be excluded. The main justification for this exclusion is the potential for these participants to be placed on other diabetes medications that may confound our study.\n* General cognition and functional performance such that a diagnosis of dementia cannot be made at the time of screening based on DSM-V criteria.\n* Vision and hearing must be sufficient for compliance with testing procedures.\n* Must have an informant to come to all appointments or be available by telephone at follow-up visits.\n\nStudy Partner Inclusion Criteria\n\n* The study partner can provide an independent evaluation of functioning for a person enrolled in the MAP study as a participant\n* The study partner agrees to attend study visits with the MAP participant or be available by telephone.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Use of metformin or any class of medication approved for treatment of diabetes, even if it is used for an indication other than diabetes (e.g., obesity), within one year of screening. These medications include GLP-1 agonists used for weight loss.\n* Body mass index \\&lt; 20 k/m2.\n* Metformin is contraindicated in persons with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of less than 30 mL/min. For persons with an eGFR of 30 to 45 mL/min, a reduction of the dose or discontinuation of the medication is recommended for those on metformin; in this range, it is also recommended that persons do not initiate metformin. Thus, participants with eGFR \\&lt; 45 mL/min will not be eligible to participate.\n* The risk of lactic acidosis is increased in persons with liver disease and class III or IV congestive heart failure. Thus, persons with liver disease other than non-fatty liver disease (e.g., cirrhosis) or class III or IV congestive heart failure will not be eligible to participate due to the risks of side effects.\n* A history of intolerance to metformin.\n* History of cerebrovascular accident with residual neurological deficits.\n* Moderate to severe depression, indicated by a score in the Geriatric Depression Scale of 9/15 or higher.\n* Dementia diagnosis\n* Lack of capacity to consent\n* Participants with neurologic diseases associated with neurologic deficits on clinical examination.\n* Participants with other current Axis I psychiatric diagnoses such as bipolar disorder or schizophrenia.\n* Alcohol or substance abuse or dependence in the past 6 months.\n* Use of medications rated as being the likely cause of cognitive impairment.

The rationale for this exclusion is persons with diabetes may already be on metformin or on other medications that increase insulin levels and could confound the trial.\n* Participants with diabetes discovered on screening based on American Diabetes Association criteria using HbA1c (HbA1c of 6.5% or greater). Although metformin could be a first treatment of diabetes for these participants, addition of treatments for diabetes by physicians could confound the study.\n* Use of any other amyloid modifying treatment for AD such as lecanemab, either experimental or approved by the Food and Drug Administration, is exclusionary. Previous use of amyloid targeting therapy that was shown to be non-efficacious (e.g., solunazemab) is not exclusionary.\n* Not able to undergo phlebotomy as reported by the participant or determined by the study coordinator or physician.\n* Participants with known, suspected, or plan for becoming pregnant.\n* The presence of a medical condition, and/or use of a medication and/or any substance, individually or in aggregate, that in the judgement of the study team, is the primary cause of cognitive impairment. For example, if hypothyroidism, cobalamin deficiency, or tertiary syphilis are reported or found during screening, they could be deemed as being likely contributors to cognitive impairment, and thus be exclusionary. Combinations of multiple medications with anti-cholinergic effects with or without other central nervous system depressants could also be considered as being causative of cognitive impairment and exclusionary.\n\nExclusion Criteria for MRI\n\nContraindications for MRI include inability to lie flat, claustrophobia, or presence of indwelling metal objects or implants that are not MRI compatible.\n\nExclusion Criteria for PET\n\nHistory of adverse reactions to radiocontrast agents.", "DESCRIPTION": "STUDY PROCEDURES AT THE LEVEL OF THE PARTICIPANT.\n\n1. Screening. We propose a 2-tier approach for screening, including telephone pre-screening followed by in-person screening. Telephone screening includes questions about inclusion and exclusion criteria including demographics (age, language), medical history, contraindications to metformin, and medications. In-person screening includes consent, in-person anthropometric measurements (height, weight, waist and hip circumference), vital signs (blood pressure and heart rate), EKG, laboratory tests (TSH, RPR, vitamin B12, complete blood count \\[CBC\\], basic metabolic panel \\[BMP\\], Hepatic panel, Lipid panel, and Hemoglobin A1c \\[HbA1c\\]), and the in person-neuropsychological battery that is used to determine aMCI.\n2. Baseline/screening study visit. History includes age, handedness, education, occupation and employment history, past medical history, and all medications utilized, including a judgment as to whether they affect cognition (positively or negatively). Referral source is also documented. Psychiatric history, current and past history of depression, current anxiety, alcohol and other substance use, head injury, hypertension, cardiac disease, thyroid disease, other major medical conditions, and surgery are evaluated at screening. A full medical history will be obtained only at screening. Any report of events, or side effects will prompt a full history and physical exam at any visit. Physical exam will be conducted at screening, with particular emphasis on signs of congestive heart failure, pulmonary, liver, or renal disease for contraindications to metformin, and neurologic examination for the presence of neurologic diseases. Vital signs including blood pressure and heart rate will also be ascertained. Standing height will be measured using a stadiometer calibrated in cm. Body weight is measured using a balance beam scale calibrated in kg. With the participant standing, measurements are taken to the nearest 0.1 kg of weight with a balance scale and height without shoes to nearest 0.5 cm, to calculate BMI (weight in k/height in m2). Waist circumference (WC) is measured at the level of the umbilicus. Hip circumference (HP) is measured at the level of maximal protrusion of the gluteal muscles. Resting Blood Pressure (BP) will be measured using an automated oscillometric device, 3 measurements will be obtained at 1-minute intervals in a seated position after 5 minutes of rest. The average of the 2nd and 3rd measurements will be recorded.\n\n   Neuropsychological battery. Total Recall Score of the Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test (FCSRT). The FCSRT is a 16 item word list with visual and auditory presentation that uses semantic cuing to facilitate encoding and retrieval. The test has a score range of 0 to 48. Paragraph Recall on the Logical Memory IIa (episodic memory): Free recall of 1 short story that consists of 25 bits of information will be elicited immediately after it is read aloud to the subject and again after approximately 30-minute delay. The total bits of information from the story that are recalled immediately (maximum score = 25) and after the delay interval (maximum score = 25) are recorded. The delay score (0-25 story units) will be used in the composite. Digit-Symbol Substitution Test: The Digit Symbol Substitution test is a subset from the WAIS-R. The test consists of 110 small blank squares presented in 7 rows with 1 of 9 numbers (1-9) randomly printed directly above each blank square. A \"key\" is printed above the rows of blank squares. The \"key\" pairs numbers 1 through 9 with an unfamiliar symbol. The subject must work as fast as possible for 90 seconds. The measure of interest is number of squares filled in correctly within the time limit (maximum raw score = 110). Mini Mental Status Exam (MMSE). The MMSE scale evaluates orientation, memory, attention, concentration, naming, repetition, comprehension, and ability to create a sentence and to copy 2 overlapping pentagons. The MMSE is scored as the number of correctly completed items with a lower score indicative of poorer performance and greater cognitive impairment. The total score ranges from 0 (worse) to 30 (perfect). Trail-Making Test, Part A: This test of visuoperceptual ability, attention and speed consists of 25 circles distributed over a white sheet of 8 1/2\" X 11\" paper that are numbered. The participant is instructed to connect the circles with a pencil line as quickly as possible all numbers in an ascending order (e.g., 1 to 2; 2 to 3; etc). The participant's performance is judged in terms of the time (in seconds) required to complete the task and by the number of errors of commission and omission. The time to complete the trial will be the measures of interest. Trail-Making Test, Part B: This test of visuoperceptual ability, attention and set-shifting ability consists of 25 circles distributed over a white sheet of 8 1/2\" X 11\" paper that are either numbered (1 through 13) or contain letters (A through L). The participant is instructed to connect the circles with a pencil line as quickly as possible while alternating between numbers and letters in an ascending order (e.g., A to 1; 1 to B; B to 2; 2 to C). The participant's performance is judged in terms of the time (in seconds) required to complete the task and by the number of errors of commission and omission. The time to complete the trial will be the measures of interest. Trail-Making Test, Part B is available in multiple forms of equal difficulty for purposes of repeated evaluations. ADAScog12. This test will be used as part of the core battery and assesses memory, reasoning, naming, orientation, ideational praxis, constructional praxis, spoken language, language comprehension, word finding difficulty, and ability to remember test instructions. The addition of a 10 word delay recall adds sensitivity in aMCI and yields maximum score of 80. Functional abilities: ADCS-ADL-PI:The ADCS-ADL-PI was developed in the ADCS Prevention Instruments Trial. The subject rates his/her performance of 18 IADL tasks over the past 2 months. Questions about use of technology (e.g., computers and cell phones) are included. Responses for each IADL include improved IADL performance (fewer errors, faster completion, less need to refer to notes or instructions), no change ('as well as usual'), various levels of impaired performance, and non-performance. Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR). The CDR is a clinical scale that rates the severity of dementia as absent, questionable, mild, moderate, or severe (CDR score of 0, 0.5, 1, 2, or 3, respectively). The score is based on interviews with the subject and study partner, using a structured interview that assesses 6 domains: memory, orientation, judgment and problem solving, community affairs, home and hobbies, and personal care. The ratings of degree of impairment obtained on each of the 6 categories of function are synthesized into 1 global rating of dementia (ranging from 0 to 3), with more refined measure of change available by use of the Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB). Reliability and validity has been established, as has high inter-rater reliability. Memory Complaint Questionnaire (MAC-Q): The MAC-Q consists of six items. The first five items relate to specific situations that are frequently reported as troublesome for those with declining memory, and the last item broadly measures overall self-perceived memory decline. Cognitive diagnoses. The research physician will complete the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Centers (NACC) Assessment and Uniform Data Set (UDS), which takes 35 minutes and includes detailed medical and family history, and neurological exam, including the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale for extrapyramidal signs, psychiatric assessment with the short version of the Geriatric Depression Scale and Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) questions, assessment of vascular risk factors plus the Hachinski scale, and a Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR). Cognitive diagnosis will be examined for inclusion and exclusion purposes and will also be examined as an exploratory outcome. For cognitive diagnosis transitions (i.e. conversion from MCI to dementia), an adjudication panel at the CCMC will conduct monthly consensus meetings or calls. This panel will be comprised of co-investigators Luchsinger, Goldberg, Devanand. During the meeting information of all the cognitive, functional and other clinical information of the subjects will be presented, blind to study allocation. Evidence of cognitive deficits (based on the neuropsychological scores), evidence of impairment in social or occupational function (as assessed by the functional measures), and evidence of cognitive and social-occupational function decline will be the criteria used for the diagnosis of dementia.\n3. Randomization. Eligible participants will be randomized in 1:1 ratio to receive either metformin or placebo, using randomly permuted block randomization of size two or four by each site to achieve balance of treatment assignment overall and by site.\n4. Titration. After participants consent, are deemed eligible, and complete the baseline assessment, they will complete a 30-day titration period in which the metformin/placebo dose will be increased from 500 mg a day at randomization in increments of 500 mg every 10 days to a maximum of 2,000 mg a day. Participants will have in person visits every 10 days to check on their drug/placebo tolerance.The metformin tablets are taken together as a single dose, usually recommended once at night. Participants will remain on the highest dose tolerated.\n5. Baseline Brain MRI. Participants will be invited to have a baseline brain MRI without contrast. We expect that brain 3T MRI will be conducted in 186 participants across all sites. MRI sequences will include 3Plane Gradient Echo Localizer, 3D MPRAGE T1, 3D T2, DTI 30 direction, DTI 30 direction, pCASL Axial, pCASL Axial Calibration. Acquisition of these sequences will take approximately 50 minutes.\n6. Baseline Brain Amyloid PET: Amyloid PET imaging will be obtained using 18F-Florbetaben. 18F-Florbetaben will be injected as 8.1 mCi, with image acquisition 90-110 min post injection (following CT or transmission scan) as 4 x 5 min frames.\n7. Baseline Tau PET: Tau PET acquisition will entail injection of 10 mCi of MK6240 with imaging from 90-110 min after CT or transmission scan.1086. Monthly and ad-lib follow-up calls, text messages, or mails. We will conduct monthly follow-up calls to inquire about adverse events and issues with metformin tolerance. We will use the ADCS Adverse Event Checklist to monitor adverse events.\n8. Follow-up visits: We will repeat all clinical (non-brain imaging) assessments at months 6, 12, and 18. The only exception is that we will test TSH and RPR only at baseline. All other laboratory tests will be repeated. Pill counts will be conducted to assess compliance with metformin and placebo. We will administer the adverse events checklist. All remaining study drug or placebo will be retrieved to assess compliance and for disposal.\n9. Follow-up Brain MRI. Participants who undergo a baseline MRI will be invited to have a follow-up brain MRI with the same sequences after the completion of the last visit at month 18. The MRI will be completed within one month of the last visit.\n10. Follow-up Brain Amyloid PET: Participants who underwent baseline amyloid PET will be invited to repeat the PET at 18 months.\n11. Follow-up Tau PET: Participants who underwent baseline Tau PET will be invited to repeat the PET at 18 months.\n12. Monthly and ad-lib follow-up calls, text messages, or mails. We will conduct monthly follow-up calls to inquire about adverse events and issues with metformin tolerance.", "SUMMARY": "MAP will be a multisite phase II/III 1:1 randomized controlled trial (RCT) of long acting metformin (reduced mass Glucophage XR) vs. matching placebo in 326 men and women with early and late aMCI, without diabetes, not treated with metformin, overweight or obese, aged 55 years to 90 years. The RCT will last 18 months and have 4 visits: baseline, 6-months, 12-months, and 18-months. The RCT will be preceded by a screening phase followed by randomization and a titration period in which drug/placebo will be titrated from 500 mg a day (one tablet) to 2,000 mg a day (4 tablets), in increments of 500 mg (one tablet) every 10 days. Participants will remain in the RCT on the tolerated dose, and included in analyses on an intent to treat basis. We expect the attrition rate to be 10%/year. Neuropsychological battery, clinical interviews, physical exam, and phlebotomy will be conducted at baseline and every 6 months. Brain MRI will be conducted in approximately half of the participants (186) twice, at baseline, and after the last study visit at month 18. We will also conduct brain amyloid Positron Emission Tomography (PET) using 18F-Florbetaben, and tau PET using 18F-MK6240 in half of the participants at baseline and end of the RCT. The primary clinical outcome of the study will be changes in the Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test. The secondary clinical outcome will be changes in the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Preclinical Alzheimer's Cognitive Composite. Secondary subclinical outcomes will be changes in cortical thickness AD signature areas, changes in white matter hyperintensity volume, changes in brain amyloid burden, changes in brain tau burden, and changes in plasma biomarkers of amyloid, tau, and neurodegeneration. The data coordinating center and Imaging Core is located at John Hopkins University. The PET coordinating center is located at UC-Berkeley.

This trial also compares more intense hormone therapy and radiation therapy to usual hormone therapy and radiation therapy in patients with high risk prostate cancer and high gene risk score. Apalutamide may help fight prostate cancer by blocking the use of androgen by the tumor cells. Radiation therapy uses high energy rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Giving a shorter hormone therapy treatment may work the same at controlling prostate cancer compared to the usual 24 month hormone therapy treatment in patients with low gene risk score. Adding apalutamide to the usual treatment may increase the length of time without prostate cancer spreading as compared to the usual treatment in patients with high gene risk score.", "STATUS": "RECRUITING", "PRIMARY_OUTCOMES": "[{'measure': 'Metastasis-free survival (MFS)', 'description': 'Assessed based on conventional imaging.

To compare the clinical activity of ATR inhibition alone to that in combination with avelumab through a randomized clinical trial for patients with advanced MCC that has progressed after PD-1 pathway blockade.\n\nII. To identify gene expression-based immunologic (replication stress / neuroendocrine \\[NE\\] differentiation) signatures predictive of response to ATR inhibition in advanced immunotherapy-refractory MCC tumors through ribonucleic acid sequencing (RNAseq).\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To examine the association of various biomarkers with the clinical activity of ATR inhibition alone or in combination with PD-(L)1 pathway blockade.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.\n\nARM 1: Patients receive tuvusertib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-14 of each cycle. Cycles repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also undergo computed tomography (CT), positron emission tomography (PET)/CT, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), biopsy, and collection of blood and stool/rectal swabs at screening and on study.

Tuvusertib is a drug that inhibits an enzyme called ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3 related (ATR) kinase, which is an enzyme that plays a role in repair of damaged deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) as well as tumor cell replication and survival. It may lead to tumor cell death by inhibiting ATR kinase activity. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as avelumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.

The usual approach for patients who are not participating in a study is treatment with intravenous (IV) (through a vein) and/or oral medications (systemic therapy) to help stop the cancer sites from getting larger and the spread of the cancer to additional body sites. Ablative means that the intention of the local treatment is to eliminate the cancer at that metastatic site. The ablative local therapy will consist of very focused, intensive radiotherapy called stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) with or without surgical resection and/or microwave ablation, which is a procedure where a needle is temporarily inserted in the tumor and heat is used to destroy the cancer cells. SABR, surgical resection, and microwave ablation have been tested for safety, but it is not scientifically proven that the addition of these treatments are beneficial for your stage of cancer. The addition of ablative local therapy to all known metastatic sites to the usual approach of systemic therapy could shrink or remove the tumor(s) or prevent the tumor(s) from returning.", "STATUS": "RECRUITING", "PRIMARY_OUTCOMES": "[{'measure': 'Overall Survival (OS)', 'description': 'o Description: The hazard ratio (HR) for OS will be estimated using a stratified Cox proportional hazards model and the 95% confidence interval (CI) for the HR will be provided.

Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Treatment for PMBCL involves chemotherapy combined with an immunotherapy called rituximab. Chemotherapy drugs work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody. It binds to a protein called CD20, which is found on B cells (a type of white blood cell) and some types of cancer cells. This may help the immune system kill cancer cells. Giving nivolumab with chemo-immunotherapy may help treat patients with PMBCL.", "STATUS": "RECRUITING", "PRIMARY_OUTCOMES": "[{'measure': 'Progression-free survival (PFS)', 'description': 'The primary analysis will be a one-sided Log-rank test stratified by choice of backbone and radiation therapy and whether the patient had a cycle of therapy prior to enrolling.', 'timeFrame': 'From enrollment on the study to first occurrence of relapse/progression or death, assessed up to 7 years'}]", "SECONDARY_OUTCOMES": "[{'measure': 'Efficacy-related event-free survival', 'description': 'Will be analyzed using a one-sided stratified Log-rank test at alpha = 0.05 or 0.025, as appropriate, with events defined as progression, change in therapy due to a finding that led to concern about efficacy, biopsy + disease after 6 cycles of therapy, and death.', 'timeFrame': 'Up to 7 years'}, {'measure': 'Therapy-related event-free survival', 'description': 'Will be analyzed using a one-sided stratified Log-rank test at alpha = 0.05 or 0.025, as appropriate, with events defined as progression, change in therapy due to a finding that led to concern about efficacy, biopsy + disease after 6 cycles of therapy, and death.', 'timeFrame': 'Up to 7 years'}, {'measure': 'Overall survival', 'description': 'Will be analyzed using a one-sided stratified Log-rank test at alpha = 0.05 or 0.025, as appropriate, with events defined as only death.', 'timeFrame': 'Up to 7 years'}, {'measure': 'Proportion of positive positron emission tomography (PET) scans', 'description': 'Will be analyzed descriptively with a point estimate and Clopper-Pearson 95% confidence interval in the trial overall and in each treatment arm separately.

An inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy (IFL) is only indicated in case of a positive SN. An IFL is associated with major morbidity, e.g. wound healing problems, lymphoceles, lymphedema of the legs and recurrent infections. GROINSS-V II investigated whether radiotherapy would be a safe alternative for IFL in case of SN metastasis. The results for radiotherapy in the group with metastasis \u2264 2mm are promising. This study also showed that for metastasis \\> 2mm, only radiotherapy was not efficient. The efficacy of treatment can be increased by adding chemotherapy or giving a higher dose of radiotherapy. GROINSS-V III will investigate this regimen.\n\nObjective:\n\nThe primary objective of this study is to investigate the safety of replacing inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy by chemoradiation in early stage vulvar cancer patients with a macrometastasis (\\>2mm) and/or extracapsular extension in the SN. The secondary objective is to evaluate the short and long-term morbidity associated with the SN procedure and chemoradiation.\n\nStudy design: Phase II treatment trial, with stopping rules for the incidence of groin recurrences.\n\nStudy population: early-stage vulvar cancer patients with a metastasis \\> 2mm in their SN, or more than one metastasis \u2264 2mm.\n\nIntervention: Participants will be treated with chemoradiation, in a total dose of 56Gy to the involved site, combined with weekly cisplatin 40mg/m2\n\nMain study parameters/endpoints: The primary endpoint is the groin recurrence rate in the first 2 years after primary treatment.\n\nNature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group relatedness: participants will be treated with chemoradiation during 5 weeks instead of surgical treatment. There is a risk that this treatment will not be as effective as surgical treatment, which may lead to more groin recurrences which are hard to treat. By continuously monitoring the groin recurrence rate the investigators will notice activation of the stopping rule as early as possible.", "SUMMARY": "Vulvar cancer patients with SN-metastasis \\> 2mm

Active malignancy or history of malignancy that was active within the last 10 years, apart from ovarian or extra-ovarian teratoma (also known as a dermoid cyst) or germ cell tumor, or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin or basal cell carcinoma of the skin, that in the opinion of the Medical Safety Monitor (MSM) would preclude enrollment due to safety concerns. Squamous cell and basal cell carcinomas should be treated with documented success of curative therapy \\> 3 months prior to randomization.\n10. At screening (repeat testing may be conducted to confirm results within the same screening period, prior to randomization), any of the following:\n\n    a. Total white blood count \\<2,500 cells/mm3 (or \\< 2.5 \u00d7 109/L) b. Total immunoglobulin \\< 600 mg/dL (or 6 \u00b5mol/L; 400 mg/dL for participants \\<18 years)\\* c.

Recurrence of previously treated NMDAR encephalitis within the last 5 years, or suspicion of symptomatic untreated NMDAR encephalitis of greater than 3 months duration at the time of screening.\n16. Evidence of active tuberculosis\\* (TB) or being at high risk for TB based on:\n\n    a. History of active TB or untreated/incompletely treated latent TB. Participants with a history of active or latent TB who have documentation of completion of treatment according to local guidelines may be enrolled.\n\n    b. History of recent (\u2264 12 weeks of screening) close contact with someone with active TB (close contact is defined as \u2265 4 hours/week OR living in the same household OR in a house where a person with active TB is a frequent visitor).\n\n    c. Signs or symptoms that could represent active TB by medical history or physical examination.\n\n    d. Positive, indeterminate, or invalid interferon-gamma release assay test result at screening, unless previously treated for TB. Participants with an indeterminate test result can repeat the test once, but if the repeat test is also indeterminate, the participant is excluded.\n\n    e.

Active, clinically significant (CS) infection at the time of randomization (IP administration may be delayed until recovery, if within 14-day screening window, otherwise participant may be rescreened).\n\nExclusion criteria are applied at time of screening and are applicable throughout the study.\n\n* Participants will undergo QuantiFERON\u00ae-TB Gold testing or equivalent TB testing during screening as standard of care. A positive result will not exclude patients from participation; thus, enrollment should not be delayed awaiting this result. If positive, an appropriate course of anti-TB treatment will need to be documented. If results are in indeterminate, participants may still be eligible for randomization if history is not suggestive of active / latent TB and a chest x-ray shows no evidence of active or latent TB.\n\n1.1 Additional Eligibility Considerations\n\nThe following criteria are not necessarily exclusionary but require review from the MSM to determine if a participant should be excluded due to safety concerns:\n\n1. At screening (out of range lab values may be reviewed with the MSM to determine whether a potential participant should be excluded for safety reasons; repeat testing may be conducted to confirm results within the same screening period, prior to randomization), any of the following:\n\n   1. Aspartate transaminase (AST) \\> 2.5 \u00d7 age-based upper limit of normal (ULN)\n   2. Alanine transaminase (ALT) \\> 2.5 \u00d7 age-based ULN\n   3. Total bilirubin \\> 1.5 \u00d7 age-based ULN (unless due to Gilbert's syndrome)\n   4. Platelet count \\< 75,000/\u03bcL (or \\< 75 \u00d7 109/L)\n   5. Hemoglobin \\< 8 g/dL (or \\< 80 g/L or 5 mmol/L)\n2. History of untreated hepatitis C infection. Participants who are considered cured following antiviral therapy with an HCV load below the limit of detection may be enrolled pending confirmation from the MSM that there are no safety concerns for inclusion.\n3. Patients with coexistent autoantibodies should not immediately be excluded but should be reviewed with the MSM to determine eligibility.", "DESCRIPTION": "N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis is one of the most common causes of autoimmune encephalitis, with prevalence exceeding herpes encephalitis in industrialized nations. Typically, the disease affects patients age 10-50 causing prominent psychiatric symptoms, altered consciousness, seizures, movement disorders and life-threatening dysautonomia. Intensive care, including cardiorespiratory support is required in 75% of cases. The diagnosis is confirmed by detection of IgG autoantibodies against central nervous system NMDAR in the cerebrospinal fluid. Despite the severity of the illness, NMDAR encephalitis is a treatable neurological disease, with retrospective case series establishing the benefit of off-label intravenous steroids and immunoglobulins. These treatments are presumed to work through effects on IgG NMDAR autoantibody levels in the CSF, although prospective data informing predictors of treatment responses are limited. Even with prompt treatment, \\~50% of patients remain disabled, requiring prolonged hospital admissions. Various off-label therapies have been proposed as \"second-line\" treatments in NMDAR encephalitis. The majority of second-line treatments target circulating B-cells with various degrees of blood brain penetrance and efficacy, and poor consensus on the timing, dose and route of delivery of candidate agents. High-quality evidence is needed to inform the treatment of NMDAR encephalitis. Inebilizumab is a promising therapeutic monoclonal antibody for the treatment of NMDAR encephalitis. This humanized monoclonal antibody against the B-cell surface antigen CD19 was recently shown to be safe and efficacious in the treatment of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder-another antibody-mediated disorder of the central nervous system. Compared to other off label B-cell depleting therapies, such as rituximab, inebilizumab not only depletes CD20+ B-cells, but also CD20- plasmablasts and plasma cells, resulting in robust and sustained suppression of B-cell expression. The ExTINGUISH Trial will randomize 116 participants with moderate-to-severe NMDAR encephalitis to receive either inebilizumab or placebo in addition to first-line therapies. Patient outcomes will be ascertained at standard intervals using the modified Rankin scale and accepted safety measures (primary outcomes at 16 weeks), together with comprehensive validated neuropsychological tests, bedside cognitive screening tools, quality of life/ functional indices, and outcome prediction measures. Clinical data will be combined with quantitative measures of NMDAR autoantibody titers and cytokines implicated in B-cell activation and antibody production within the intrathecal compartment to identify treatment responders, inform the biologic contributors to outcomes, and evaluate for biomarkers that may serve as early predictors of favorable outcomes in future clinical trials in NMDAR encephalitis. The ExTINGUISH Trial will prospectively study an optimized B-cell depletion therapy to promote better long-term outcomes in NMDAR encephalitis, to determine more meaningful cognitive endpoints, and to identify better biologic biomarkers to predict outcome.", "SUMMARY": "Determine the difference in the modified Rankin score at 16 weeks in participants with anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)

Teclistamab (JNJ-64007957) is a full-size, Immunoglobulin G (IgG) 4 proline, alanine, and alanine (PAA) bispecific antibody that targets the cluster of differentiation (CD3) receptor expressed on the surface of T cells and B cell maturation antigen (BCMA). With its dual binding sites, teclistamab is able to draw CD3 positive T cells in close proximity to BCMA positive cells, resulting in T-cell activation and subsequent lysis of BCMA positive cells. Pomalidomide is a third-generation immunomodulatory imide drug (IMiD) that exerts potent, direct tumoricidal and immune-enhancing effects and Carfilzomib is a second-generation proteasome inhibitor that inhibits proteasome which results in disruption of protein turnover and induces apoptosis. The primary hypothesis of this study is that teclistamab monotherapy (Arm A) will significantly improve progression free survival (PFS) compared with investigator's choice of PVd or Kd (Arm B) in participants with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who have received 1 to 3 prior lines of therapy, including an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody and lenalidomide.

Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as durvalumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Chemotherapy drugs, such as paclitaxel, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. There is some evidence from previous clinical trials that people who have a MammaPrint Ultrahigh Risk result may be more likely to respond to chemotherapy and immunotherapy. Adding durvalumab to usual chemotherapy may be able to prevent the cancer from returning for patients with MP2 stage II-III hormone receptor positive, HER2 negative breast cancer.", "STATUS": "RECRUITING", "PRIMARY_OUTCOMES": "[{'measure': 'Breast cancer event-free survival (BC-EFS)', 'description': 'Defined as the earliest occurrence of any of the following events: Local-regional or distant progression during neoadjuvant therapy or local/regional, or distant invasive breast tumor recurrence post-surgery, invasive ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence, new invasive contralateral breast cancer, or death from any cause.

With the surge in cases, the cost of treatment has also increased substantially. In 2014, it has been reported that treatment of kidney stones cost a total of 2.81 billion USD, and this is projected to increase by 1.24 billion USD per year. Although there has been great technological advancement in surgical treatment of kidney stones, such as minimally invasive surgery, the rate of recurrence is unfortunately high among stone formers, upwards of 50 percent at 5-10 years. Recurring stone disease results in more frequent surgical interventions and further expense. Thus, there is an increasing need for primary stone prevention.\n\nKidney stones have varying compositions with the most common being calcium oxalate. Uric acid stones are the third most common type of stone and account for 10 percent of all stone formers. One of the common abnormalities for patients with calcium oxalate stones, is low citrate levels in the urine. Citrate is the primary inhibitor of calcium oxalate crystal formation, growth, and aggregation. As such, regimens to increase urinary citrate have been undertaken. The most common drug used in this regard is potassium citrate (i.e., Urocit K). While effective, the drug remains costly with prescription costs ranging as high as $450/month. With regard to uric acid stone formation, a prerequisite is an acidic urine given that the pKa for uric acid is a pH of 5.5; once the pH is above 6.0, uric acid stones do not form. Indeed, the uric acid stone is the only one that can be dissolved if one is able to raise the pH to 6.5 -7.0.\n\nCurrent medical therapy for hypocitraturia in patients with calcium oxalate stones, is the use of a slow-release tablet of potassium citrate (e.g., UrocitK). Current medical therapy for uric acid stone formers is likewise potassium citrate as it will raise the urine pH. A prescription of potassium citrate with the typical dosage of 30 meq twice a day can cost the patient upwards of $450/month. Additionally, potassium citrate tablets are associated with adverse effects such as nausea and diarrhea with additional concerns with respect to the potassium load among patients with poor renal function. Furthermore, the wax matrix tablets are large in size and difficult to swallow.\n\nPinheiro et al. in a prior study demonstrated that sodium bicarbonate in tablet form at a dose of 60 milliequivalent (mEq) per day was comparable to Urocit-K in increasing urinary pH and urinary citrate levels in calcium stone forming hypocitriuric patients. The study was limited by a small sample size (n=16) and short duration of therapy (3 days). Despite these favorable results, over the ensuing decade, there has been minimal interest in the use of sodium bicarbonate as a preventative treatment in stone formers who are hypocitriuric or uric acid stone formers.\n\nBaking soda is a common household item and is openly available throughout the world in most grocery stores. The main component of baking soda is sodium bicarbonate. Various studies have shown that a teaspoon of baking soda (4.8g) has an equivalent of 59 mEq of sodium bicarbonate. A pound of baking soda, or 96 teaspoons, costs $1 which reduces the cost of a daily dosage of 60 mEq to less than a penny. The cost of 60 mEq (seven 650 mg Pills) of Sodium Bicarbonate in pill form is 15 cents.\n\nInvestigators hypothesize that the use of baking soda in stone formers with calcium oxalate associated hypocitraturia or with uric acid stones will increase urinary citrate and increase urine pH to the benefit of both patient groups. If proven effective, this approach could markedly lower the risk of stone formation in calcium oxalate and uric acid stone formers, while providing an inexpensive solution on a global level to an otherwise very expensive and debilitating ailment.", "SUMMARY": "The incidence of kidney stone disease continues to rise globally. Although the treatment of kidney stone disease has dramatically improved in recent years, surgical management remains invasive and expensive. Patients who develop kidney stones are at high risk of recurrence during their lifetime; therefore, prevention of stones should be a primary focus. Low levels of citrate and acidic urine are risk factors for the formation of kidney stones such as calcium oxalate and uric acid, respectively. Calcium oxalate stones are the predominant stone composition in the United States, accounting for over 2/3rds of stones. Citrate is a key inhibitor of calcium oxalate crystal formation and thus increasing it in the urine of a calcium oxalate stone former is quite beneficial. Uric acid stones account for approximately 10 percent of all stone types. These stones form primarily due to an acidic urinary environment which is a prerequisite for crystal formation. Common medications for stone formers include potassium citrate which help to make the urine more alkaline. Although effective, these medications have side effects and may prove to be too expensive (upwards of $450/month). Consuming baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) may prove to be an inexpensive ($0.34/month) equally effective alternative with respect to increasing urinary citrate levels and alkalinizing the urine. Investigators hypothesize that twice a day oral baking soda in a liquid medium (e.g., water, orange juice, soda, etc.) can be an effective, and inexpensive alternative to urocit K with regard to alkalinizing the urine and raising urinary citrate levels.", "STATUS": "RECRUITING", "PRIMARY_OUTCOMES": "[{'measure': 'Change in 24-hour Urinary pH', 'description': 'The first primary outcome will be the change in urinary pH determined from the 24-hour urine analysis test conducted by Litholink\u00ae.\\n\\nOutcome variable: 24-hour urine pH greater than 6 (reference range from 5.8 to 6.2 pH).', 'timeFrame': '12 weeks'}, {'measure': 'Change in 24-hour Urinary Citrate', 'description': 'The second primary outcome will be the change in urinary citrate determined from the 24-hour urine analysis test conducted by Litholink\u00ae.\\n\\nOutcome variable: 24-hour urine citrate greater than 450 milligrams per 24-hour (320 to 1,240 milligrams per 24-hour).', 'timeFrame': '12 weeks'}]", "SECONDARY_OUTCOMES": "[{'measure': 'Change in Supersaturation of Calcium Oxalate', 'description': 'The first secondary outcome will be the change in urinary supersaturation, specifically calcium oxalate, determined from the 24-hour urine analysis test conducted by Litholink\u00ae.\\n\\nOutcome variables: Supersaturation of calcium oxalate less than 4.00 supersaturation units (reference range from 6-10 supersaturation units).', 'timeFrame': '12 weeks'}, {'measure': 'Change in Supersaturation of Uric acid', 'description': 'The second secondary outcome will be the change in urinary supersaturation, specifically uric acid, determined from the 24-hour urine analysis test conducted by Litholink\u00ae.\\n\\nOutcome variables: Supersaturation of uric acid less than 1.00 supersaturation units (reference range from 0 to 1.00 supersaturation units).', 'timeFrame': '12 weeks'}]", "AGE_DESCRIPTION": "ADULT, OLDER_ADULT", "CONDITIONS": ["Uric Acid Stones", "uric acid", "hypocitraturia"], "OVERALL_OFFICIALS": "[{'name': 'Ralph V Clayman, MD', 'affiliation': 'University of California, Irvine', 'role': 'PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR'}, {'name': 'Sohrab N Ali, M.D', 'affiliation': 'University of California, Irvine', 'role': 'STUDY_DIRECTOR'}, {'name': 'Ralph Victor Clayman', 'affiliation': 'University Of California, Irvine'}]", "LOCATIONS": "[{'facility': 'University of California, Irvine Medical Center', 'city': 'Orange', 'state': 'California', 'country': 'United States'}]", "RARE_DISEASE": "U", "MANAGEMENT_GROUPS": ["Admin Team D", "Urology (primary)"], "DISEASE_SITES": ["Urology"], "TREATMENT_TYPE_DESC": "INT - Dietary supplement", "PHASE_DESC": "I", "SCOPE_DESC": "Local"}, {"NCT_ID": "NCT04548752", "TITLE": "Randomized Phase II Clinical Trial of Olaparib + Pembrolizumab vs. Olaparib Alone as Maintenance Therapy in Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer Patients With Germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 Mutations", "ORGANIZATION": "{'fullName': 'National Cancer Institute (NCI)', 'class': 'NIH'}", "SHORT_TITLE": "Testing the Addition of Pembrolizumab, an Immunotherapy Cancer Drug to Olaparib Alone as Therapy for Patients With Pancreatic Cancer That Has Spread With Inherited BRCA Mutations", "SPONSOR": "['SWOG']", "DETAILED_ELIGIBILITY": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients must have a histologic or cytologic diagnosis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma.

BRCA1 and BRCA2 are human genes that produce tumor suppressor proteins. These proteins help repair damaged deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and, therefore, play a role in ensuring the stability of each cell's genetic material. When either of these genes is mutated, or altered, such that its protein product is not made or does not function correctly, DNA damage may not be repaired properly. As a result, cells are more likely to develop additional genetic alterations that can lead to some types of cancer, including pancreatic cancer. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Olaparib is an inhibitor of PARP, a protein that helps repair damaged DNA. Blocking PARP may help keep tumor cells from repairing their damaged DNA, causing them to die. PARP inhibitors are a type of targeted therapy. The addition of pembrolizumab to the usual treatment of olaparib may help to shrink tumors in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations.", "STATUS": "RECRUITING", "PRIMARY_OUTCOMES": "[{'measure': 'Progression-free survival (PFS)', 'description': 'Primary analysis of PFS will be conducted in all eligible patients according to the intent-to-treat principle using a log rank test stratified by first line chemotherapy, performance status and disease status after first line platinum-based treatment.

Patients also receive peposertib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28, and avelumab intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on days 1 and 15.

Peposertib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as avelumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Hypofractionated radiation therapy delivers higher doses of radiation therapy over a shorter period of time and may kill more tumor cells and have fewer side effects. Giving peposertib in combination with avelumab and hypofractionated radiation therapy may work better than other standard chemotherapy, hormonal, targeted, or immunotherapy medicines available in treating patients with solid tumors and hepatobiliary malignancies.", "STATUS": "RECRUITING", "PRIMARY_OUTCOMES": "[{'measure': 'Maximum tolerated doses and recommended phase 2 dose of peposertib (M3814) in combination with hypofractionated radiation and avelumab (Phase I)', 'description': 'Will be determined by the occurrence of dose-limiting toxicities defined as the occurrence of one or more grade 3 adverse events that delays treatment for more than 7 days, or any grade 4-5 adverse events.', 'timeFrame': 'Up to 28 days'}, {'measure': 'Objective response rate (ORR) (Phase 2)', 'description': 'Defined as best overall response (compete response \\\\[CR\\\\] and partial response \\\\[PR\\\\] in non-irradiated lesions as opposed to stable disease \\\\[SD\\\\] or progressive disease \\\\[PD\\\\]) by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1).', 'timeFrame': 'Up to 12 months'}]", "SECONDARY_OUTCOMES": "[{'measure': 'Pharmacokinetics of avelumab (Phase 1)', 'description': 'Will determine concentrations of plasma avelumab using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).', 'timeFrame': 'Day 7: predose, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 and 24 hours; Day 21: predose, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 hours'}, {'measure': 'Pharmacokinetics of M3814 (Phase 1)', 'description': 'Will determine concentrations of plasma M3814 using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)/MS.', 'timeFrame': 'Day 21: predose'}, {'measure': 'Disease control rate (DCR) (Phase 2)', 'description': 'Defined as proportion of patients achieving a CR, PR, or SD in non-irradiated by RECIST 1.1 criteria.

This study is in people with advanced cancer for whom previous treatment was not successful.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to find out the highest dose of BI 764532 that people with a brain tumour that is positive for DLL3 can tolerate. BI 764532 is an antibody-like molecule that can attach and link together the cancer cells and T-cells of the immune system (DLL3/CD3 bispecific). This may help the immune system fight cancer.\n\nParticipants get BI 764532 infusions into a vein when starting treatment. If there is benefit for the participants and if they can tolerate it, the treatment is continued. During this time, participants visit the study site at regular intervals. The total number of visits depends on how they respond to and tolerate the treatment. The first study visits include staying to monitor participants' safety.

The usual approach for patients is treatment with FOLFOX chemotherapy. Chemotherapy drugs work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Fluorouracil stops cells from making DNA and it may kill tumor cells. Leucovorin is used with fluorouracil to enhance the effects of the drug. Oxaliplatin works by killing, stopping, or slowing the growth of tumor cells. Some patients also receive an immunotherapy drug, nivolumab, in addition to FOLFOX chemotherapy. Immunotherapy may induce changes in body's immune system and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Irinotecan blocks certain enzymes needed for cell division and DNA repair, and it may kill tumor cells. Adding irinotecan to the FOLFOX regimen could shrink the cancer and extend the life of patients with advanced gastroesophageal cancers.", "STATUS": "RECRUITING", "PRIMARY_OUTCOMES": "[{'measure': 'Overall survival (OS)', 'description': 'Will compare the distributions of OS between the two treatment arms to determine if patients treated with modified fluorouracil, leucovorin calcium, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan (mFOLFIRINOX) (with or without nivolumab) have an OS benefit compared to those treated with fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) (with or without nivolumab).
