Please note this may not be a complete list of eligibility criteria. We have included a few examples of study criteria to help you better understand how your eligibility in the study will be determined; your study team will go through the study eligibility criteria with you to verify if you qualify for participation in this study.

You can participate in this study if you have or are being evaluated for a blood disorder

Exclusion Requirements
You cannot participate in this study if you are pregnant.</DETAILED_ELIGIBILITY>
    <DESCRIPTION>UC Irvine Medical Center is both a treatment and a research hospital. As a patient here, you may be treated
by some doctors who are also researchers performing studies to improve treatments currently available.

Scientists and clinicians at this institution are working together to discover new ways to treat cancer and
new ways to make current treatments safer and more effective. In order to conduct this research, we need
to study samples of normal and disease tissue obtained from normal volunteers and our patients. In order
to minimize the discomfort and risk to subjects, we are seeking to collect tissue that is left over from studies
that are required for your evaluation and care and are already being done. In certain circumstances (blood
draw and bone marrow aspiration) we are seeking to collect a small amount of tissue in addition to the
sample that would be collected for your routine care. Except for giving samples of blood, you will not be
asked to undergo any procedure solely for the purpose of obtaining a sample for this study. 

You are being asked to take part in this research study because you have or are being evaluated for a
hematologic malignancy, bone marrow disorder, or immune system disorder.

This research study involves the collection and storage of blood and other tissue for later research testing.
It is not currently known how samples donated to the repository will be used at this time. These research tests may be developed during the time you are a patient at UC Irvine Medical Center, or in some cases, years later. Any researcher at UCI or their collaborators (including for-profit entities) may request permission to use samples from the repository. Frozen de-identified samples will be provided to researchers after their plans have been evaluated and approved by the UCI review board that oversees human research (IRB). These tests may provide additional information that will be helpful in understanding cancer and other diseases, but it is unlikely that what we learn from these studies will benefit you directly.

These studies may benefit other patients in the future. The research performed on these samples may
include the study of genetics, including the subject&amp;#8217;s DNA code, parts or the DNA code or even whole
genome sequencing. Samples from the repository will not be used to create cell lines.

    <DESCRIPTION>
    Advances in the treatment of malignant melanoma are being developed in terms of medical information on
diagnosis, surgery, adjuvant therapy and post-treatment surveillance. The purpose of this protocol would be to
create a data repository by collecting key data elements to watch for patterns within melanoma to potentially
help future patients. By collecting this data, we intend to assess trends by watching for patterns of melanoma
inclusive of treatment, criteria for staging, time to recurrence, population, patients at risk for recurrence,
survival of patients, and time to death. The collection of this data will include a retrospective collection of
historical patients and a prospective collection from new patients within the melanoma UC Irvine Health clinics

We have included a few examples of study criteria to help you better understand how your eligibility in the study will be determined; your study team will go through the study eligibility criteria with you to verify if you qualify for participation in this study.

Inclusion Requirements
You can participate in this study if you 
&amp;#8226;	Are a male or female subject, 18 years of age or older 
&amp;#8226;	Are able to adhere to the study visit schedule and other protocol requirements
&amp;#8226;	Have a confirmed diagnosis of locally advanced or metastatic solid tumor that has a specific gene rearrangement

Exclusion Requirements 
You cannot participate in this study if you
&amp;#8226;	Are pregnant or breastfeeding, or intending to become pregnant during the study 
&amp;#8226;	Are currently participating in another therapeutic clinical trial
&amp;#8226;	Have a known active infection (bacterial, fungal, or viral, including human immunodeficiency virus positivity).</DETAILED_ELIGIBILITY>
    <DESCRIPTION>This study has 2 parts (Phase 1 and Phase 2): 
&amp;#8226;	Phase 1: Phase 1 of this research study is currently ongoing. It was the first time that the study drug, reprotrectinib, was given to humans.
o	The purpose of Phase 1 was to determine the dose of repotrectinib to use in Phase 2 of the study.  Phase 1 look at the side effects and response of tumors to different doses of repotrectinib. Phase 1 also looked at how different foods affect how repotrectinib gets into the body. Phase 1 includes the following sub-studies:
&amp;#61607;	Phase 1a, where the study drug is given under fasting conditions. You will need to fast 1 hour before and 2 hours after study drug administration. As of November 5th 2018, this part of the study is completed and will not enroll any new subjects
&amp;#61607;	Phase 1b is a Food Effect Sub-Study (a study within a study). You may be asked to participate in the Food Effect Sub-Study. The purpose of the Food Effect Sub-Study is to determine the effect of high-fat, high-calorie food on a single dose of repotrectinib (how much and how fast repotrectinib gets into the body after a meal). As of November 5th 2018, this part of the study is completed and will not enroll any new subjects.
&amp;#61607;	Phase 1 also includes a study of repotrectinib when administered continuously with food, where you will take every dose of the study drug with a standard meal, called Phase 1c. 
&amp;#8226;	Phase 2: You are being asked to participate in Phase 2 of this study (not Phase 1). The purpose of Phase 2 is to determine, more specifically, whether repotrectinib works, especially in groups of subjects who have the various tumor gene rearrangements mentioned above. Phase 2 will also continue to look at the side effects as well as how repotrectinib is absorbed into the body.
The Phase 2 portion of the study will evaluate the anti-cancer activity of repotrectinib at the dose listed below:
&amp;#8226;	160 mg once a day for 14 days that may increase to 160 mg twice a day based on the drug&amp;#8217;s tolerability 
The study doctor will assess and decide if your dose should be increased or decreased.
 No study procedures related to this study will be performed until you have signed this Informed Consent Form. A copy of the signed Informed Consent Form will be given to you to keep.</DESCRIPTION>

    <DESCRIPTION>This phase III trial studies how well chemotherapy and radiation therapy work with or without atezolizumab in treating patients with localized muscle invasive bladder cancer. Radiation therapy uses high energy rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Chemotherapy drugs, such as gemcitabine, cisplatin, fluorouracil and mitomycin-C, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving chemotherapy with radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as atezolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving atezolizumab with radiation therapy and chemotherapy may work better in treating patients with localized muscle invasive bladder cancer compared to radiation therapy and chemotherapy without atezolizumab.

    <DETAILED_ELIGIBILITY>Eligibility Criteria:

- Patient must have diagnosed anal cancer with tumors measuring less than or equal to 4 cm within 4 weeks prior to registration. 
- Patient's tumor size must be documented on physical examination including digital rectal exam and/or anoscopy/proctoscopy within 4 weeks prior to Step 0 pre-registration.
- Patient must have no history of prior radiation or chemotherapy for carcinoma of the anus.
- Patient must not have had prior potentially curative surgery (i.e. abdominal-perineal resection) for carcinoma of the anus.</DETAILED_ELIGIBILITY>
    <DESCRIPTION>This phase II trial studies how well lower-dose chemotherapy plus radiation (chemoradiation) therapy works in comparison to standard-dose chemoradiation in treating patients with early-stage anal cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as mitomycin, fluorouracil, and capecitabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Giving chemotherapy with radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells. This study may help doctors find out if lower-dose chemoradiation is as effective and has fewer side effects than standard-dose chemoradiation, which is the usual approach for treatment of this cancer type.</DESCRIPTION>

    <DESCRIPTION>The purpose of this research study is to see if sequential intravenous chemotherapy followed by intraperitoneal chemotherapy with paclitaxel combination is safe and will improve cancer control in patients who have gastric cancer that is spread in the abdominal lining ( peritoneum) called peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC). Currently, patients with gastric cancer who have cancer spread to the abdominal lining are only treated with intravenous chemotherapy, which is chemotherapy administered through the vein into the body. We are proposing to add intraperitoneal chemotherapy (chemotherapy infused into the abdominal cavity through a small access device implanted into the abdominal fat tissue) to the usually used intravenous chemotherapy, to study if this combination improves survival in patients.</DESCRIPTION>

    <DESCRIPTION>This phase II trial studies how well radium-223 dichloride and paclitaxel work in treating patients with advanced breast cancer that has spread to the bones. Radium-223 dichloride is a radioactive drug that behaves in a similar way to calcium and collects in cancer that has spread to the bones (bone metastases). The radioactive particles in radium-223 dichloride act on bone metastases, killing the tumor cells and reducing the pain that they can cause. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving radium-223 dichloride and paclitaxel may work better in treating patients with metastatic breast cancer compared to paclitaxel alone</DESCRIPTION>

    <DESCRIPTION>This phase I/II trial studies the best dose and side effects of peposertib and to see how well it works with avelumab and hypofractionated radiation therapy in treating patients with solid tumors and hepatobiliary malignancies that have spread to other places in the body (advanced/metastatic). Peposertib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as avelumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Hypofractionated radiation therapy delivers higher doses of radiation therapy over a shorter period of time and may kill more tumor cells and have fewer side effects. Giving peposertib in combination with avelumab and hypofractionated radiation therapy may work better than other standard chemotherapy, hormonal, targeted, or immunotherapy medicines available in treating patients with solid tumors and hepatobiliary malignancies.</DESCRIPTION>

    <DESCRIPTION>This phase III trial compares the effect of usual treatment of chemotherapy and steroids and a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) to the same treatment plus blinatumomab. Blinatumomab is a Bi-specific T-Cell Engager ('BiTE') that may interfere with the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. The information gained from this study may help researchers determine if combination therapy with steroids, TKIs, and blinatumomab work better than the standard of care.</DESCRIPTION>

    <DESCRIPTION>This phase III trial compares early treatment with venetoclax and obinutuzumab versus delayed treatment with venetoclax and obinutuzumab in patients with newly diagnosed high-risk chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma. Venetoclax may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as obinutuzumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Starting treatment with the venetoclax and obinutuzumab early (before patients have symptoms) may have better outcomes for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma compared to starting treatment with the venetoclax and obinutuzumab after patients show symptoms.</DESCRIPTION>

-HER2-positive status will be based on pretreatment biopsy material and defined as an immunohistochemistry (IHC) score of 3+ and/or positive by in situ hybridization (ISH) according to current American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) College of American Pathologists (CAP) guidelines. Central testing is not required
* Known hormone receptor (HR) status as defined by ASCO/CAP guidelines (based on pretreatment biopsy material). Hormone receptor positive status can be determined by either known positive estrogen receptor (ER) or known positive progesterone receptor (PR) status; hormone receptor negative status must be determined by both known negative ER and known negative PR
-Patients with clinical stage T1-4, N0-3 disease at presentation and residual invasive disease postoperatively as defined above are eligible. (Note: Patients with T1a/bN0 tumors are not eligible at initial breast cancer diagnosis are not eligible)
-Patients with residual HR-negative, HER2 positive (+) disease in the breast and/or lymph nodes per the surgical pathology report are eligible; however, patients with HR+ HER2+ cancers must have node-positive residual disease per the surgical pathology report in order to qualify for the study. The presence of residual invasive disease in the breast is not mandatory for these patients
-Patients with weakly ER-positive (1-10%) breast cancer (based on the pretreatment core biopsy) are eligible even if they have node-negative disease per the surgical pathology report
-The residual disease tissue (breast and/or lymph nodes) is not required to be HER2-positive, as eligibility for NCI-2020-03770 (A011801) is based on a positive HER2 status at the time of the initial breast cancer diagnosis
* Note: The presence of micrometastases in lymph nodes after preoperative therapy counts as residual disease, whereas the presence of isolated tumor cells does not

Exclusion Criteria:
-No adjuvant treatment with any anti-cancer investigational drug within 28 days prior to registration
-Not pregnant and not nursing, because this study involves an agent that has known genotoxic, mutagenic and teratogenic effects. Therefore, for women of childbearing potential only, a negative serum pregnancy test done =&lt; 7 days prior to registration is required
-Patients with known active and/or untreated hepatitis B or hepatitis C or chronic liver disease are ineligible. Patients with a diagnosis of hepatitis B or C that has been treated and cleared and normal liver function are eligible to participate in the study if the other eligibility parameters are met</DETAILED_ELIGIBILITY>
    <DESCRIPTION>This phase III trial studies how well trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) and tucatinib work in preventing breast cancer from coming back (relapsing) in patients with high risk, HER2 positive breast cancer. T-DM1 is a monoclonal antibody, called trastuzumab, linked to a chemotherapy drug, called DM1. Trastuzumab is a form of targeted therapy because it attaches to specific molecules (receptors) on the surface of cancer cells, known as HER2 receptors, and delivers DM1 to kill them. Tucatinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving T-DM1 and tucatinib may work better in preventing breast cancer from relapsing in patients with HER2 positive breast cancer compared to T-DM1 alone.</DESCRIPTION>

    <DESCRIPTION>This study will test an experimental drug (enfortumab vedotin) alone and with different combinations of anticancer therapies. Pembrolizumab is an immune checkpoint inhibitor (CPI) that is used to treat patients with cancer of the urinary system (urothelial cancer). This type of cancer includes cancer of the bladder, renal pelvis, ureter or urethra. Some parts of the study will look at locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer (la/mUC), which means the cancer has spread to nearby tissues or to other areas of the body. Other parts of the study will look at muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC), which is cancer at an earlier stage that has spread into the muscle wall of the bladder. This study will look at the side effects of enfortumab vedotin alone and with other anticancer therapies. A side effect is a response to a drug that is not part of the treatment effect. This study will also test if the cancer shrinks with the different treatment combinations.</DESCRIPTION>

    <DESCRIPTION>Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common cancer seen in pediatric oncology. The necessary chemotherapy for pediatric and adolescent and young adult (AYA) patients with ALL includes steroids, anthracyclines, asparaginase, and vincristine. One of the most hepatotoxic chemotherapy agents is asparaginase, with treatment-associated hepatotoxicity (TAH) observed in up to 60% of patients. The frequency of TAH is increased in overweight or obese patients of Latino heritage. Carnitine is a naturally-derived compound that is produced in the liver and kidneys; it is found in certain foods, such as meat, poultry, fish, and some dairy products. Endogenous carnitine transports long-chain fatty acids into the mitochondria, where they are oxidized to produce energy, and acts as scavengers of oxygen free radicals. Thus, carnitine can reduce oxidative stress and modulate inflammatory response. Levocarnitine is a supplement form of carnitine used typically in the care and management of patients with carnitine deficiency. Pediatric and AYAs with ALL will be given oral levocarnitine as a supplement during their initial phases of treatment, when the most hepatotoxic agents are administered, to determine if the incidence of liver toxicity can be reduced or eliminated.

    <DESCRIPTION>This trial studies how well atezolizumab added to the usual radiation therapy works in treating patients with stage I-IIA non-small cell lung cancer. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as atezolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Radiation therapy, such as stereotactic body radiation therapy, uses special equipment to position a patient and deliver radiation to tumors with high precision. This method can kill tumor cells with fewer doses over a shorter period and cause less damage to normal tissue. Giving atezolizumab and radiation therapy may work better than radiation therapy alone in treating patients with early non-small cell lung cancer.</DESCRIPTION>

    <DESCRIPTION>This phase II trial studies the effect of sacituzumab govitecan in treating patients with HER2-negative breast cancer that has spread to the brain (brain metastases). Sacituzumab govitecan is a monoclonal antibody, called sacituzumab, linked to a chemotherapy drug, called govitecan. Sacituzumab is a form of targeted therapy because it attaches to specific molecules on the surface of cancer cells, known as Trop-2 receptors, and delivers govitecan to kill them. Giving sacituzumab govitecan may shrink the cancer in the brain and/or extend the time until the cancer gets worse.</DESCRIPTION>

    <DESCRIPTION>Brief Summary:
The primary objective of the dose escalation (phase 1) part of the study is:

To assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics (PK) of the antibody drug conjugate (ADC) REGN5093-M114 in order to determine a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or define the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of REGN5093-M114 in patients with mesenchymal epithelial transition factor (MET) overexpressing non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

The primary objective of the dose expansion (phase 2) part of the study is:

To assess preliminary anti-tumor activity of REGN5093-M114 in MET-overexpressed NSCLC as measured by the objective response rate (ORR)

The secondary objective of the dose escalation (phase 1) part of the study is:

To assess preliminary anti-tumor activity of REGN5093-M114 as measured by the ORR

The secondary objective of the dose expansion (phase 2) part of the study is:

To assess the safety, tolerability profile, and PK of REGN5093-M114 ADC and total antibody in each expansion cohort

The secondary objectives of both phases of the study are:

To evaluate other measures of preliminary anti-tumor activity
To assess immunogenicity to REGN5093-M114</DESCRIPTION>

    <DESCRIPTION>This study is being done to test ERAS-007 in combination with other drugs for the treatment of advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer.  The study is divided into sub-studies based on mutation status and number of prior therapies.  You are being asked to take part in this portion of the research study because you have been diagnosed with a type of advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer with a specific change (or mutation) in the BRAF gene (BRAF V600E).  This change leads to the uncontrolled growth and spread of the affected colon cells into colon cancer.  ERAS-007 in combination with other therapies is designed to target these mutations.  ERAS-007 is an investigational drug that has shown anti-cancer activity in animals and humans by blocking a cell pathway that contributes to cancer formation and progression.  Investigational means that the drug has not been approved by health authorities, such as the United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA), for the treatment of people with your medical condition.</DESCRIPTION>

- You have confirmed anal cancer (includes basaloid and cloacogenic lesions).
- You are a woman and currently not pregnant or breast-feeding.
- You have not had prior immunotherapy. 
</DETAILED_ELIGIBILITY>
    <DESCRIPTION>This study is being done to answer the following question: Will adding an immune checkpoint inhibitor to the usual combination of chemotherapy drugs help prevent your cancer from getting worse?
We are doing this study because we want to find out if this approach is better or worse than the usual approach for your anal canal cancer. The usual approach is defined as care most people get for naïve metastatic anal cancer. These treatments may reduce symptoms and may stop the tumor from growing for a few months or longer.

    <DESCRIPTION>This phase III trial compares the effects of nivolumab with chemo-immunotherapy versus chemo-immunotherapy alone in treating patients with newly diagnosed primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL). Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Treatment for PMBCL involves chemotherapy combined with an immunotherapy called rituximab. Chemotherapy drugs work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody. It binds to a protein called CD20, which is found on B cells (a type of white blood cell) and some types of cancer cells. This may help the immune system kill cancer cells. Giving nivolumab with chemo-immunotherapy may help treat patients with PMBCL.</DESCRIPTION>

Exclusion Criteria: 
- Prior systemic chemotherapy within =&lt; 3 years prior to registration; note that prior chemotherapy for a different cancer is allowed (completed &gt; 3 years prior to registration)
- Prior radical prostatectomy
- Prior radiotherapy to the region of the study cancer that would result in overlap of radiation therapy fields</DETAILED_ELIGIBILITY>
    <DESCRIPTION>This phase III trial compares less intense hormone therapy and radiation therapy to usual hormone therapy and radiation therapy in treating patients with high risk prostate cancer and low gene risk score. This trial also compares more intense hormone therapy and radiation therapy to usual hormone therapy and radiation therapy in patients with high risk prostate cancer and high gene risk score. Apalutamide may help fight prostate cancer by blocking the use of androgen by the tumor cells. Radiation therapy uses high energy rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Giving a shorter hormone therapy treatment may work the same at controlling prostate cancer compared to the usual 24 month hormone therapy treatment in patients with low gene risk score. Adding apalutamide to the usual treatment may increase the length of time without prostate cancer spreading as compared to the usual treatment in patients with high gene risk score.</DESCRIPTION>

Giving capecitabine and temozolomide after surgery could prevent or delay the return of cancer in patients with high-risk well-differentiated pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors.</DESCRIPTION>

    <DETAILED_ELIGIBILITY>You may be able to take part in this study if you:
-have previously untreated AML,
-are positive for FLT3 gene mutation and
-are greater than or equal to 75 years of age and ineligible for intensive chemotherapy or greater than or equal to 18 to 74 years of age and has other disease or medical conditions that make you ineligible for intensive chemotherapy
However, there is a chance you still may not be able to participate. You will need to go through tests and procedures to see if you meet all the requirements to take part in this study.
You will not be able to take part in this study if you:
- have certain medical conditions that would limit your compliance with study requirements or impact your safety by participation in this study
- have received certain treatments for AML,
- require treatment with concomitant drugs that are strong inducers CYP3A or P-gp during study,
- have known or suspected hypersensitivity to gilteritinib, azacitidine or venetoclax or any components of the formulations,
-are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant during the study, or
-are participating in another treatment clinical study or receiving treatment with any other investigational agents/drugs</DETAILED_ELIGIBILITY>
    <DESCRIPTION>People with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are usually treated with chemotherapy. Some people with AML have a changed FLT3 gene which causes leukemia cells to grow faster. Therefore, chemotherapy is less suitable to treat AML in people with the changed FLT3 gene.

Gilteritinib, given with venetoclax and azacitidine, is a potential new treatment for people with AML with the changed FLT3 gene. They cannot have chemotherapy due to old age or other conditions. Before these combined 3 medicines are available as a treatment, the researchers need to understand how they are processed by and act upon the body when given together. In this study, they do this to find a suitable dose for venetoclax and to check for potential medical problems from the treatment.</DESCRIPTION>

    <DETAILED_ELIGIBILITY>Eligibility Criteria:

- Patient must have histological or cytological diagnosis of pancreatic adenocarinoma.
- Patient must have one of the following mutations: germline mutation in BRCA 1 or 2 from a CLIA certified lab defined as positive and/or deleterious (pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant).
- Patient must have metastatic disease and received first line platinum-based chemotherapy (i.e. FOLFIRINOX, FOLOFX, gemcitabine + nab-paclitaxel + cisplatin or gemcitabine + cisplatin). </DETAILED_ELIGIBILITY>
    <DESCRIPTION>The purpose of this study is to compare the usual treatment (olaparib) alone to using pembrolizumab plus the usual treatment.  The addition of pembrolizumab to the usual treatment could help to shrink your cancer   but, it could also cause side effects. This study will help the study doctors find out if this different approach is  better, the same, or worse than the usual approach.  To decide if it is better, the study doctors will be looking to see if the study drug pembrolizumab increases the time it takes for the cancer to grow  by 5 months or more compared to the usual approach.  

Olaparib alone has been approved as maintenance therapy for patients with germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutated pancreatic cancer. </DESCRIPTION>

    <DETAILED_ELIGIBILITY>You need to have the following exams, tests or procedures to find out if you can be in the study:

- You will be asked about your health history including any surgeries you've had and the treatments you've received for your cancer. 
- Complete physical exam 
- Performance status assessment, to see how able you are to perform your daily activities. 
- Measurement of your height and weight
- Vital sign measurements, including blood pressure, heart rate, breathing (respiratory) rate, and body temperature.
- Routine blood tests [about 13 mL or 2 ½ teaspoons of blood (in total)] to test your:

- blood counts (white blood cells, red blood cells, etc.),
- liver, kidney, and thyroid function,
- cholesterol while fasting (no food within 6 hours),
- blood clotting ability.

- Blood test [about 1.5 mL or ¼ teaspoon of blood] for specific viruses, including hepatitis B and hepatitis C, and HIV. If you have positive test results for HIV or Hepatitis B or C, we will notify you. We are required to notify state health authorities of positive results.
- Routine urine testing
- Blood or urine test for pregnancy, if you are a woman who is capable of childbearing (unless you have had a hysterectomy or your tubes tied, or you are in menopause and your last menstrual period was at least 1 year ago). 
 
- Evaluation of the location and size of your cancer will be performed. 

- Your doctor may use different types of imaging, such as computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), clinical exam or some combination of these tests.

- Electrocardiogram (ECG): a test that measures the electrical activity of your heart by using electrodes placed on your body. This assessment is not invasive which means that it does not involve the introduction of instruments or other objects into the body or body cavities.
-You will be asked about all medications (including over-the-counter and herbal remedies) you are taking and have taken in the past month.
- You will be asked to describe any symptoms you are currently experiencing.</DETAILED_ELIGIBILITY>

    <DETAILED_ELIGIBILITY>Inclusion Criteria:
- Expected survival &gt;=12 weeks
- Histologically-confirmed, locally-advanced, unresectable or metastatic urothelial cancer (LA/mUC), including UC originating from the renal pelvis, ureters, bladder, or urethra

Exclusion Criteria:
- Known hypersensitivity to disitamab vedotin, pembrolizumab (in Cohort C), or any of their components
- Prior antitumor treatment (including chemotherapy, radiotherapy, targeted therapy, immunotherapy etc.) within 2 weeks of start of study
- Major surgery that has not fully recovered within 4 weeks prior to dose administration</DETAILED_ELIGIBILITY>
    <DESCRIPTION>This study is being done to see if a drug called disitamab vedotin, alone or with pembrolizumab, works to treat HER2 expressing urothelial cancer. It will also test how safe the drug is for participants.

Participants will have cancer that has spread in the body near where it started (locally advanced) and cannot be removed (unresectable) or has spread through the body (metastatic).

It will also study what side effects happen when participants get the drug. A side effect is anything a drug does to your body besides treating the disease.</DESCRIPTION>

You must have no radiographic evidence of overt metastatic disease within 28 days prior to study entry (CT with IV contrast or MRI imaging is acceptable and must include chest, abdomen, and pelvis).
The distal extent of the tumor must be greater than or equal to 12 cm from the anal verge on colonoscopy or above the peritoneal reflection as documented during surgery or on pathology specimen (i.e., excluding rectal adenocarcinomas warranting treatment with chemoradiation).
You must have had an en bloc complete gross resection of tumor (curative resection). Patients who have had a two-stage surgical procedure, to first provide a decompressive colostomy and then in a later procedure to have the definitive surgical resection, are eligible.

Exclusion Criteria:
Colon cancer histology other than adenocarcinoma (i.e., neuroendocrine carcinoma, sarcoma, lymphoma, squamous cell carcinoma, etc.).
Pathologic, clinical, or radiologic overt evidence of metastatic disease. This includes isolated, distant, or non-contiguous intra-abdominal metastases, even if resected.
Tumor-related bowel perforation.
History of prior invasive colon malignancy, regardless of disease-free interval.
History of bone marrow or solid organ transplantation (regardless of current immunosuppressive therapy needs). Bone grafts, skin grafts, corneal transplants and organ/tissue donation are not exclusionary.
Any prior systemic chemotherapy, targeted therapy, or immunotherapy; or radiation therapy administered as treatment for colorectal cancer (e.g., primary colon adenocarcinomas for which treatment with neoadjuvant chemotherapy and/or radiation is warranted are not permitted).
Other invasive malignancy within 5 years before study entry. Exceptions are colonic polyps, non-melanoma skin cancer or any carcinoma-in-situ.
Synchronous primary rectal and/ or colon cancers.</DETAILED_ELIGIBILITY>

-Patients must have undergone initial cholecystectomy within 12 weeks</DETAILED_ELIGIBILITY>
    <DESCRIPTION>This phase II/III trial compares the effect of adding chemotherapy before and after surgery versus after surgery alone (usual treatment) in treating patients with stage II-III gallbladder cancer. Chemotherapy drugs, such as gemcitabine and cisplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving chemotherapy before surgery may make the tumor smaller; therefore, may reduce the extent of surgery. Additionally, it may make it easier for the surgeon to distinguish between normal and cancerous tissue. Giving chemotherapy after surgery may kill any remaining tumor cells. This study will determine whether giving chemotherapy before surgery increases the length of time before the cancer may return and whether it will increase a patient's life span compared to the usual approach.</DESCRIPTION>

    <DETAILED_ELIGIBILITY>Inclusion Criteria:
You must have a histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the colon or rectum. The date of diagnosis will be determined according to the pathologic date of diagnosis
You must have measurable disease according to RECIST1.1 criteria. Computed tomography (CT) scans or magnetic resonance imaging (MRIs) used to assess measurable disease must have been completed within 28 days prior to registration. CT scans or MRIs used to assess non-measurable disease must have been completed within 42 days prior to registration. All disease must be assessed and documented on the Baseline Tumor Assessment Form
You must have documented unresectable and/or metastatic disease on CT or MRI imaging. All disease must be assessed and documented on the Baseline Tumor Assessment Form
You must have BRAF^V600E mutated colorectal cancer as tested in a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act (CLIA)-certified laboratory
You must have proficient mismatch repair (pMMR) or microsatellite stable (MSS) status as tested in a CLIA-certified laboratory and documented by the treating clinician. Proficient mismatch repair status can be determined by intact expression by immunohistochemistry of all 4 mismatch repair proteins (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2). Microsatellite instability can be determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)

Exclusion Criteria:
You must not have a known positive serology for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Encorafenib is contraindicated with concomitant use of non-nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitors like efavirenz and etravirine. In addition, it is recommended in the investigator brochure of encorafenib to avoid using encorafenib with protease inhibitors. Therefore, because all participants on this study would receive encorafenib for either randomized arm of treatment, participants with HIV who receive these components of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) would be at high risk for complications of drug-drug interaction
You must not have had prior treatment with a BRAF inhibitor (including, but not limited to, encorafenib, dabrafenib, or vemurafenib), MEK inhibitor (including, but not limited to, trametinib, selumetinib, or binimetinib), or ERK inhibitor (of note, regorafenib is not considered a BRAF inhibitor for the context of eligibility criteria)
You must not have had prior treatment with anti-EGFR therapies
You must not have had prior treatment with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, anti-PD-L2, anti-CTLA-4 antibody, or any other antibody or drug specifically targeting T-cell co-stimulation or immune checkpoint pathways</DETAILED_ELIGIBILITY>
    <DESCRIPTION>This phase II trial tests whether adding nivolumab to the usual treatment (encorafenib and cetuximab) works better than the usual treatment alone to shrink tumors in patients with colorectal cancer that has spread to other places in the body (metastatic) or that cannot be removed by surgery (unresectable) and whose tumor has a mutation in a gene called BRAF. Encorafenib is in a class of medications called kinase inhibitors. It is used in patients whose cancer has a certain mutation (change) in the BRAF gene. It works by blocking the action of mutated BRAF that signals cancer cells to multiply. This helps to stop or slow the spread of cancer cells. Cetuximab is in a class of medications called monoclonal antibodies. It binds to a protein called EGFR, which is found on some types of cancer cells. This may help keep cancer cells from growing. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving nivolumab in combination with encorafenib and cetuximab may be more effective than encorafenib and cetuximab alone at stopping tumor growth and spreading in patients with metastatic or unresectable BRAF-mutant colorectal cancer.

    <DESCRIPTION>We are enrolling cancer of the blood and bone marrow patients. In this study, we are looking at a new investigational drug called LYT-200 that is intended to inhibit (hinder) galectin-9. Galectin-9 is a protein which suppresses immune functionand disables immune-mediated attack on the cancer cells through multiple pathways. At present, there are no approved therapies targeting galectin-9 for any disease. Early studies conducted in 
animals suggest LYT-200 might be a good treatment for patients with blood and bone marrow 
cancer.
This study is among the first research studies of LYT-200 in people and its main purpose is to 
test its safety and tolerability in patients suffering from two types of blood and bone marrow 
cancer: acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). In this study we 
shall also examine how the drug is changed by and removed from the body and will look for 
signs that the drug may be effective against AML or MDS. LYT-200 will be tested at several 
different doses.

    <DESCRIPTION>This phase III trial compares the effect of adding lomustine to temozolomide and radiation therapy versus temozolomide and radiation therapy alone in shrinking or stabilizing newly diagnosed MGMT methylated glioblastoma. Chemotherapy drugs, such as lomustine and temozolomide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Radiation therapy uses high energy photons to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Adding lomustine to usual treatment of temozolomide and radiation therapy may help shrink and stabilize glioblastoma.</DESCRIPTION>

    <DESCRIPTION>The investigators will perform a global, Phase III, randomized, double-blind controlled trial of rFVIIa plus best standard therapy vs. placebo and best standard therapy alone. The investigators will include participants with a volume of ICH &amp;#8805; 2 and &lt; 60 cc, no more than a small volume of intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) (IVH score &amp;#8804; 7), age &amp;#8805; 18 and &amp;#8804; 80, Glasgow Coma Scale of &amp;#8805; 8, and treated within 120 minutes from stroke onset. To minimize time-to-treatment, the study will use emergency research informed consent procedures (including exception from informed consent (EFIC) in the United States) and mobile stroke units (MSUs), with a goal of ½ of participants treated within 90 minutes, as accomplished in the NINDS t-PA trials. The FASTEST Trial will include approximately 100 hospital sites and at least 15 MSUs in the NINDS-funded StrokeNet and key global institutions with large volumes of ICH patients and the ability to treat them within 120 minutes of stroke onset. Recruitment of 860 participants over 3½ years is planned. Countries participating in the trial include the United States, Canada, Japan, Germany, Spain, and the United Kingdom.

Participants will be randomized in a double-blinded fashion to rFVIIa 80 µg/kg dose (maximum 10 mg dose) or placebo. Participants in both arms will receive best standard therapy as per published AHA Guidelines for ICH, including a target systolic blood pressure of 140 mm Hg. The primary outcome (ordinal mRS with the following categories: 0-2, 3, and 4-6) will be determined at 180 days, but participants will be followed by remote assessment at 30 days and 90 days. To measure growth of ICH, all participants will have a standard of care baseline non-contrast CT of the head and a repeat scan at 24 hours. Centralized volumetric measurements of ICH, IVH, and edema will be performed for both time points.

Novo Nordisk A/S will manufacture and supply rFVIIa as a research medication for use in the FASTEST Trial. Novo Nordisk A/S will also manufacture and supply matching placebo that is identical to rFVIIa in appearance and administration.</DESCRIPTION>

    <DESCRIPTION>This home-based randomized clinical trial is designed to test the efficacy of ZA-5 mg in Parkinson's disease (PD) and parkinsonism patients. This trial will also address barriers to treatment of patients with PD and parkinsonism by providing rigorous evidence about whether ZA reduces fracture risk in patients with PD and parkinsonism, simplifying treatment by giving ZA at home without extra medical visits and BMD testing, and overcoming poor persistence with oral therapies because one infusion may prevent bone loss for at least 2 years. The outcome of this trial will demonstrate how a home-based fracture prevention can reach older PD patients who would not otherwise receive treatment to reduce their high risk of fractures.

Patients with PD will be recruited throughout the US by participating neurologists and health networks as well as the Parkinson's Foundation. Patients may also self-refer to the study. Interested patients can access study information on a study website (topaz.eurekaplatform.org) as well as through the Parkinson's Foundation Helpline. Patients who wish to enroll will be directed to an interactive electronic consent (eConsent). Following eConsent, participants complete a screening questionnaire (to confirm eligibility), followed by a baseline questionnaire. If a participant is determined to be eligible following these steps, they may be scheduled for a Telemedicine assessment to further confirm the PD or parkinsonism diagnosis, unless they have been referred directly from a participating neurologist. If confirmed, the participant will be mailed a supply of vitamin D3 800-1000 IU and instructed to take one vitamin D tablet every day for 2 months. Lastly, a Nurse Home Visit will be scheduled and conducted to confirm final eligibility, randomization, and administration of the study drug, if appropriate. Participants who are randomized will be contacted every 4 months for at least 2 years to determine if they have had any fractures.</DESCRIPTION>

    <SUMMARY>Thoracic injuries represent the third most common cause of death in trauma patients after abdominal and head injuries.1 Rib fractures cause a significant amount of pain and are associated with an increased risk of pneumonia, prolonged hospitalization, and increased healthcare costs. In a national database review, rib fractures were associated with a 10% mortality rate, however, with every additional rib fracture there was an increase in mortality.2 Elderly patients are especially vulnerable with a mortality nearly double that of their younger counterparts.3,4 Optimizing analgesia has become cornerstone in the management of rib fractures, improved pain control leads to better pulmonary mechanics and fewer complications. Most often this is done with either an epidural catheter or a multimodal pain regimen consisting of: acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), trans-dermal lidocaine, muscle relaxants, and opioids.5 Unfortunately, epidural catheters are an invasive procedure and have associated complications, and opioids can cause respiratory suppression and risk of addiction. 
Dexmedetomidine (precedex) is a promising alternative to treat acute pain associated with rib fractures. Dexmedetomidine is a selective alpha 2 agonist that has sedative, analgesic, and sympathetic properties with less respiratory depression compared to opioids.6 Dexmedetomidine is routinely used in the ICU for sedation and has shown promise as an analgesic. Multiple systemic reviews and meta-analysis have suggested the benefits of dexmedetomidine for post-operative pain. Studies have shown that dexmedetomidine can decrease pain scores, decrease morphine equivalents, and decrease adverse events from opioids.7-9 
Given the lack of evidence and prospective data on the use of IV dexmedetomidine in the treatment of acute pain in rib fractures, we plan to perform a prospective randomized control trial to test the efficacy of dexmedetomidine as an adjunct analgesic. We hypothesize that a continuous infusion of dexmedetomidine will decrease pain scores and opioid use in patients presenting with multiple rib fractures. </SUMMARY>

    <DESCRIPTION>Although bariatric surgery is the most effective treatment for severe obesity, a large proportion of patients experience significant weight regain with longer follow-up.

In this randomized controlled trial employing a SMART design, a total of 120 subjects with weight regain after bariatric surgery, will be initially randomized in a 3:3:2 ratio to daily treatment with topiramate (TPM) 50 mg or phentermine (PHEN) 7.5 mg or placebo. After 4 months, responders (those with &amp;#8805;5% weight loss) will continue the same treatment, while nonresponders will be re-randomized to a higher dose of the same drug or phentermine/topiramate 7.5/50 mg combination (PHEN/TPM) during Months 5-12. All subjects will receive diet and lifestyle counseling throughout the study.

Aim 1: To determine whether pharmacotherapy can reverse post-bariatric surgery weight regain.

Hypothesis: Compared to placebo, all three active drug therapies - TPM, PHEN, and PHEN/TPM will lead to greater percent weight loss at Month 12.

Aim 2: To examine change in energy intake assessed by a dietitian interview.

Hypothesis: Compared to placebo, active drug therapies will lead to greater reduction in energy intake at Month 12.

Aim 3: To examine changes in the most common maladaptive eating behaviors in the post-bariatric surgery patients - grazing, loss-of-control eating, and binge eating.

Hypothesis: Compared to placebo, active drug therapies will lead to decreased maladaptive eating behaviors.</DESCRIPTION>

    <DESCRIPTION>The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy, safety, and feasibility of offering electroacupuncture as an intervention to improve cancer-related symptoms (cognitive impairment, fatigue, psychological distress and insomnia) and quality of life among cancer patients and survivors receiving care at UCI Health. In addition, changes in biomarkers (plasma BDNF, pro-inflammatory cytokines and mitochondrial DNA) known to be associated with cancer-related symptoms. We hypothesize that EA is an effective, safe, and feasible intervention for cancer patients and survivors.

Our specific aims are as follows:

To compare the efficacy of EA versus sham-EA control in reducing cognitive toxicity, fatigue, psychological distress, insomnia and quality of life.

To evaluate the impact of EA versus sham-EA control on biomarkers, including circulating BDNF, pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1&amp;#946;, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, TNF-alpha), mitochondrial DNA (oxidative stress indicator), and safety.

To assess the feasibility of administering EA to manage symptom clusters in cancer patients.</DESCRIPTION>

    <DETAILED_ELIGIBILITY>Study Population:
Patients with HD and their family members are recruited from specialty clinics (Human Genetics, Neurology, Psychiatry) that advise and treat people affected by HD. In addition, in some areas community clinics and neurologists who see HD patients recruit participants for this study. Participants also receive information about the study through websites, clinical practices, support groups, advocacy newsletters, etc. and place a direct request to be considered for participation in the study. Community controls are identified by study site staff (using advertisements, flyers and newsletters) with the support of the Enroll-HD operational staff.

Inclusion Criteria:
1.  Carriers: This group comprises the primary study population and consists of individuals who carry the HD gene expansion mutation.
2.  Controls: This group comprises the comparator study population and consists of individuals who do not carry the HD expansion mutation.
3.  These two major categories can be further subdivided into six different subgroups of eligible individuals:
4.  Manifest/Motor-manifest HD: Carriers with clinical features that are regarded in the opinion of the investigator as diagnostic of HD.
5.  Pre-Manifest/-Motor-manifest HD: Carriers without clinical features regarded as diagnostic of HD.
6.  Genotype Unknown: This group includes a first or second degree relative (i.e., related by blood to a carrier) who has not undergone predictive testing for HD and therefore has an undetermined carrier status.
7.  Genotype Negative: This group includes a first or second degree relative (i.e., related by blood to a carrier) who has undergone predictive testing for HD and is known not to carry the HD expansion mutation.
8.  Family Control: Family members or individuals not related by blood to carriers (e.g., spouses, partners, caregivers).
9.  Community Controls: Individuals unrelated to HD carriers who did not grow up in a family affected by HD. Data collected from community controls will be used for generation of normative data for sub-studies.
10.  Participant status will be captured in the study database using 2 variables: 1) Investigator Determined Status: this will be based on clinical signs and symptoms and genotyping performed as part of medical care, and will be updated at every visit; and 2) Research Genotyping Status: this will be based on genotyping conducted as part of Enroll-HD study procedures. Based on research genotyping, participants will be reclassified under this variable from Genotype Unknown to 'Carriers' or 'Controls'. Investigators and participants will be blinded to this reclassification.

Exclusion Criteria:
1.  Individuals who do not meet inclusion criteria,
2.  Individuals with choreic movement disorders in the context of a negative test for the HD gene mutation.

    <DESCRIPTION>The primary objective of Enroll-HD is to develop a comprehensive repository of prospective and systematically collected clinical research data (demography, clinical features, family history, genetic characteristics) and biological specimens (blood) from individuals with manifest HD, unaffected individuals known to carry the HD mutation or at risk of carrying the HD mutation, and control research participants (e.g., spouses, siblings or offspring of HD mutation carriers known not to carry the HD mutation). Enroll-HD is conceived as a broad-based and long-term project to maximize the efficiencies of non-clinical research and participation in clinical research. With 158 active clinical sites in 19 countries, Enroll-HD is now the largest HD database available and is accessible to any interested researcher - visit www.enroll-hd.org/for-researchers/access-data/ to learn more.</DESCRIPTION>

    <SUMMARY>Enroll-HD is a longitudinal, observational, multinational study that integrates two former Huntington's disease (HD) registries-REGISTRY in Europe, and COHORT in North America and Australasia-while also expanding to include sites in Latin America. More than 20,000 participants have now enrolled into the study. With annual assessments and no end date, Enroll-HD has built a large and rich database of longitudinal clinical data and biospecimens that form the basis for studies developing tools and biomarkers for progression and prognosis, identifying clinically-relevant phenotypic characteristics, and establishing clearly defined endpoints for interventional studies. Periodic cuts of the database are now available to any interested researcher to use in their research - visit www.enroll-hd.org/for-researchers/access-data/ to learn more.</SUMMARY>

    <DESCRIPTION>The objective of the Corrona Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD) Registry is to create a national cohort of patients with IBD. The diseases under study include Crohn's Disease (CD) and Ulcerative Colitis (UC). Data collected will be used to better characterize the natural history of the disease and to extensively evaluate the effectiveness and safety of medications approved for the treatment of IBD. This will be done through the standardized collection of validated patient-reported outcomes (PRO) and clinician-reported outcomes (ClinRO), the prevalence and incidence of comorbidities and adverse events, medication utilization patterns, and patient productivity measures.

The design is a prospective, non-interventional registry for patients with IBD under the care of a certified gastroenterologist. Longitudinal follow-up data is collected from both patients and their treating gastroenterologist during routine clinical encounters using Corrona registry questionnaires. These questionnaires collect data on patient demographics, disease duration, medical history (including all prior and current treatments for IBD), smoking status, alcohol use, disease activity and severity, pain, as well as other clinician- and patient-reported outcomes, comorbidities and adverse events, infections, hospitalizations, and other targeted safety outcomes.

After the enrollment visit, IBD patients and physicians will complete the follow-up questionnaires during regularly scheduled clinical encounters. The goal is to collect data from patients and providers at six month intervals, not to exceed 2 visits in any 12 month period.

Adverse events may be volunteered spontaneously by the subject, or be discovered as a result of general questioning by the Investigator. During all Corrona related visits with the Investigator, subjects will be questioned regarding the occurrence of adverse events.</DESCRIPTION>

    <DESCRIPTION>The genetic heterogeneity has been a barrier to broad natural history efforts, with prior investigations often limited to single gene mutations. Much attention is paid to the variability within individual mutations (e.g. distal presentations), as opposed to defining the best strategy for measuring change in overall LGMD disease burden. This presents a major dilemma for LGMD rare disease research: how to balance diverse genes leading to overlapping phenotypes, versus variants in the same gene leading to divergent phenotypes. What is clear, is as a group, LGMDs are chronic and progressive leading to significant lifetime morbidity and represent a large unmet clinical need.

Recent developments in the investigator's genetic understanding of LGMD and molecular approaches to therapy have led to proposed gene replacement therapies for at least three of the LGMD mutations. Several of these gene replacement therapies are currently in pre-clinical/phase 1 testing, leading to an urgent need for natural history data. In addition, non-specific therapies which target muscle mass or function are being tested in other muscular dystrophies and may prove beneficial for LGMD.</DESCRIPTION>

    <SUMMARY>Limb Girdle Muscular Dystrophy comprise a group of disorders made up of over 30 mutations which share a common phenotype of progressive weakness of the shoulder and hip girdle muscles. While the individual genetic mutations are rare, as a cohort, LGMDs are one of the four most common muscular dystrophies. The overall goal of project 1 is to define the key phenotypes as measured by standard clinical outcome assessments (COAs) for limb girdle muscular dystrophies (LGMD) to hasten therapeutic development.</SUMMARY>

    <DETAILED_ELIGIBILITY>Inclusion Criteria
1. Age &gt;= 18 years (male or female)
2. Currently hospitalized for AHF defined as meeting all the following criteria:
a. Presentation with worsening symptoms of heart failure (e.g., worsening dyspnea or dyspnea at rest, progressive fatigue, rapid weight gain, worsening edema/abdominal distention/anasarca)
b. Objective signs or diagnostic testing consistent with volume overload (e.g., jugular venous distension, pulmonary basilar crackles, S3 gallop, ascites, hepatomegaly, peripheral edema, radiological evidence of pulmonary congestion, noninvasive or invasive hemodynamic evidence of elevated filling pressures)

    <DESCRIPTION>The HEALEY ALS Platform Trial is a perpetual multi-center, multi-regimen clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of investigational products for the treatment of ALS. This trial is designed as a perpetual platform trial. This means that there is a single Master Protocol dictating the conduct of the trial.

In this trial, multiple investigational products for ALS will be tested simultaneously or sequentially. Each investigational product will be tested in a regimen. Each regimen consists of a placebo-controlled trial, meaning that the active investigational product and matching placebo will be tested in each regimen.

The additional details that govern the testing of each investigational product will be summarized in separate regimen-specific appendices (RSAs). Each regimen will have a separate ClinicalTrials.gov posting, which will include specific information about the regimen. All regimen-specific outcome measures will be detailed in each regimen posting.

Participants will have an equal chance to be randomized to all regimens that are active at the time of screening. Once randomized to a regimen, participants will be randomized in a 3:1 ratio to either study drug or placebo.

    <DESCRIPTION>Etavopivat is designed to activate PKR and thereby modulate RBC metabolism by impacting two critical pathways in RBCs. The etavopivat clinical development program will investigate whether decreasing 2,3-DPG may help oxygen bind to hemoglobin (i.e. increasing oxygen affinity), and thereby increase ATP and impact RBC function. This study is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter Phase 2/3 study of patients age 12 to 65 years (inclusive), with sickle cell disease. There are two planned interim analyses in this study design. Initially, patients will be randomized at 1:1:1 to one of two dose levels of etavopivat or placebo. At the first interim analysis, one of the two etavopivat dose levels will be selected for the Phase 3 portion of the study, in which patients will be randomized at 1:1 to the selected etavopivat dose or placebo. Efficacy on hemoglobin will be evaluated at the second interim analysis, and then will be tested along with evaluation of efficacy on vaso-occlusive crises at the final analysis. Following completion of 52 weeks of double-blind treatment, patients may enter a 52-week etavopivat open-label extension period.</DESCRIPTION>

    <DETAILED_ELIGIBILITY>Inclusion Criteria:
1.  Adult patients &gt;18 years old
2.  Cysts &gt; 20 mm in size deemed appropriate for FNA by the endoscopist, based on clinical presentation, radiologic imaging features, associated solid mass or nodules, and patient anxiety about the diagnosis

Exclusion Criteria:
1.  Age &lt;18 years
2.  Inability to provide informed consent
3.  Thrombocytopenia (Platelets &lt; 50,000) or coagulopathy (INR &gt; 1.8)
4.  Pregnancy
5.  Post-surgical anatomy where the cyst is not accessible for FNA
6.  EUS findings suggesting that cyst FNA would be unsafe (e.g. intervening blood vessels)
7.  EUS appearance suggesting FNA is not indicated (e.g. cyst smaller than prior radiologic imaging, cyst not seen, EUS suggestive of serous cystadenoma)</DETAILED_ELIGIBILITY>
    <DESCRIPTION>Pancreatic cystic lesions (PCLs) are a common incidental finding in cross sectional imaging (up to 27% on CT scan and 41% on MRI) and pose a management challenge to physicians. According to society guidelines, PCLs with specific features should prompt additional workup with endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) for cyst characterization as well as cyst sampling. This can help determine if the cyst is mucinous or non-mucinous which has implications for its malignant potential. Cyst fluid has traditionally been sampled using EUS with FNA (Fine-Needle Aspiration) and sent for fluid analysis (CEA and amylase) and cytology. However, despite use of a cyst fluid carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level cutoff of 192 ng/mL and cytology, accuracy of diagnosis for PCLs is poor. As the spectrum ranges from benign to high risk for neoplasm, precise diagnosis is critical. More recently, the adjunctive use of the Moray® through the needle microforceps biopsy (EUS-MFB) has shown promise for diagnosis of PCLs. This technology utilizes a microforceps through a 19-guage needle to biopsy the cyst wall for histology, in addition to collecting cyst fluid for CEA level and cytology. Only a few small retrospective reports have been published regarding the use of MFB. Pancreatic cysts continue to pose a management dilemma for practicing clinicians, especially with the increased use of radiologic imaging modalities identifying incidental pancreatic cystic lesions with higher frequency. This leads to patient anxiety and increased costs due to radiologic surveillance and even surgery. The results of this study will hopefully help increase diagnostic yield by obtaining a histopathologic diagnosis of these PCLs, and potentially affect practice patterns of gastroenterologists and the endoscopic community, specifically those physicians who perform EUS in these patients. Furthermore, the results will help determine whether there is reason to continue this line of research to obtain a definite histologic tissue diagnosis of PCLs.</DESCRIPTION>

    <DETAILED_ELIGIBILITY>Inclusion Criteria:

Medicare beneficiary with Medicare as primary insurance;
Meets clinical criteria for Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) or Dementia as defined by the 2018 National Institute on Aging - Alzheimer's Association Research Framework
Brain MRI and/or CT within 24 months prior to enrollment;

    <DESCRIPTION>A total of 7,000 Medicare beneficiaries meeting the study's eligibility criteria will be consented and enrolled over 30 months at sites throughout the United States. To ensure diversity, the study will enroll at least 2,000 Blacks/African Americans, at least 2,000 Latinos/Hispanics, and up to 3,000 additional participants from other racial and ethnic backgrounds. Based on disease stage prior to PET, all participants will be classified as having MCI or dementia as their disease stage. Based on their clinical presentation prior to PET, all participants will be classified as having "typical" (i.e. progressive amnestic) or "atypical" clinical presentations of AD as the potential cause of dementia or MCI.

Dementia specialists will team with PET facilities that have trained radiologists/nuclear medicine physicians and access to perform amyloid PET. All participating physicians and study staff will complete comprehensive training to ensure adherence of data requirements and study timelines. Amyloid PET will be performed and interpreted at each facility with results provided to the ordering dementia specialist for support in further decision making. The dementia specialists will record their diagnosis and intended management plan based on the current clinical and diagnostic information, and assuming no future access to amyloid PET at the "Pre-PET visit." This represents a "thought experiment" documenting the management plan that would be recommended by the specialist if the participant were not enrolling in New IDEAS and thus had no access to amyloid PET. PET results will be disclosed to patients and any consequent changes in management (if any) will be recommended at the "PET disclosure visit." Patients will return 90 ± 30 days following PET for an in person "Post-PET visit." At this final visit, the dementia specialists will record the diagnosis and implemented management plan, incorporating amyloid PET into clinical decision making. Medicare claims data will be collected directly from CMS for 12 months prior to the PET imaging and 12 months after the PET imaging, for each participant.

Aim 1 utilizes Medicare claims data to compare 12-month claims-derived outcomes in amyloid PET-positive versus amyloid PET-negative individuals with MCI and dementia across the entire cohort. Aims 2 and 3 investigate these associations in sub-groups of study participants based on self-identified race and ethnicity (Aim 2) and clinical presentation (Aim 3). Aims 2 and 3 additionally evaluate changes in management between the pre- and post-PET visits in the relevant sub-groups, to test whether benefits in health outcomes are mediated by changes in clinical management. The investigator's over-arching hypothesis, supported by preliminary data from the first IDEAS study, is that amyloid PET results will be associated with changes in clinical management, which in turn will translate into improved health outcomes in patients with amyloid PET-positive scans in comparison with patients with amyloid PET-negative scans. We further hypothesize that these effects will be seen across patients of different ethnoracial backgrounds, clinical presentations and disease stages (MCI and dementia).

Optional components of the study include the collection and archival of participant's amyloid PET images, and blood plasma. These repositories will serve as a resource to the field, enabling the testing and validation of emerging genetic and blood biomarkers. Separate consent will be obtained for participation in these components.</DESCRIPTION>

    <SUMMARY>New IDEAS is an observational, open-label, longitudinal cohort study designed to address the requirements of the CED provisions of the NCD on beta-amyloid PET. Building on the initial Imaging Dementia-Evidence for Amyloid Scanning (IDEAS) study, New IDEAS will evaluate the association between amyloid PET and patient-centered outcomes in an expanded and more ethnoracially and clinically diverse group of Medicare participants presenting with cognitive impairment.

    <DESCRIPTION>his is a prospective natural history study on patients with clinically defined sIBM. Participants will be assessed every 6 months over two years (five visits total). We will include 150 participants with sporadic IBM, diagnosed according to established criteria. Participants will require an routine serum sample via blood draw to evaluate for NT5c1A antibody status. This testing will be performed at Washington University School of Medicine in the Neuromuscular Laboratory. Investigators will be blinded to antibody status. A subset of participants (40) will undergo a muscle biopsy at the Baseline visit.

Aim 1. To determine for the first time whether NT5c1A antibodies mediate disease progression over a two-year interval in patients with sIBM.

We will perform a prospective, non-interventional, observational study on patients with sIBM with follow up and evaluations every 6 months over a two-year time frame. Primary analyses are: 1) the rates of disease progression and severity as measured by rates of decline in IBM Functional Rating Scale (IBMFRS) score and Timed Get Up and Go (TUG); 2) the presence or absence of serum antibodies to NT5c1A; and 3) the presence and frequency of variant T-cells in the serum and skeletal muscle.

Aim 2. To perform a detailed morphological, histochemical and immunohistochemical analysis of fresh muscle biopsy specimens obtained from a subset of patients with sIBM.

Aim 3. To characterize the distribution of "immunosenescent" lymphocytes in circulating blood from patients with sIBM.

Aim 4. To quantify the decline in the respiratory function of sIBM patients.</DESCRIPTION>

    <DESCRIPTION>This double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study will evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of three different dose levels of Auxora in patients with acute pancreatitis and accompanying SIRS.

Approximately 216 patients will be randomized 1:1:1:1 into one of 4 groups using a computer generated randomization scheme accessed through an interactive voice/web response system (IXRS). Randomization will be first stratified by gender (male or female) and then by risk for organ failure in the gender subgroups (higher or lower). Higher risk for organ failure is defined by the presence of both an elevated hematocrit (HCT &amp;#8805;44% for men or &amp;#8805;40% for women) and hypoxemia (imputed PaO2/FiO2 &amp;#8804;360). Lower risk for organ failure is defined by the absence of either or both an elevated hematocrit and hypoxemia. The PaO2/FiO2 will be determined using an arterial blood gas or imputed using pulse oximetry.

All patients will have received a Screening CECT of the abdomen/pancreas before being randomized into the study. CECTs performed as standard of care may be used as the Screening CECT but must have been performed in the 24 hours before Consent or after Consent and before Randomization.

The Start of First Infusion of Study Drug (SFISD) should occur within 8 hours of the patient or LAR providing informed consent. Patients randomized to Group 1 will receive 2.0 mg/kg of Auxora intravenously every 24 hours (±1 hour) for a total of three doses. Patients randomized to Group 2 will receive 1.0 mg/kg of Auxora intravenously every 24 hours (±1 hour) for a total of three doses. Patients randomized to Group 3 will receive 0.5 mg/kg of Auxora intravenously every 24 hours (±1 hour) for a total of three doses. Patients randomized to Group 4 will receive emulsion without any active pharmaceutical ingredient. Patients in Group 4 will receive one of three randomly assigned dose volumes, 1.25 mL/kg, 0.625 mL/kg, or 0.3125 mL/kg, which will be administered intravenously every 24 hours (±1 hour) for a total of three doses. The dosing will be based on actual body weight obtained at the time of hospitalization or screening for the study. As described in the pharmacy manual, the upper limit of the volume of Auxora and volume of Placebo that will be administered will be 156.25 mL. The sponsor, investigators and patients will be blinded to the assigned group. In the event of a medical emergency, investigators will be able to receive the treatment assignment if required to provide optimal care of the patient.

For all 4 groups, a study physician or appropriately trained delegate will perform assessments at screening, at the baseline assessment, immediately prior to the SFISD, and then every 24 hours until 240 hours after the SFISD, or until discharge if earlier. If patients remain hospitalized at Day 12, assessments will then be performed every 48 hours starting on Day 12 until Day 28, or until discharge if earlier. Patients discharged from the hospital before Day 25 will return at Day 30 (+5 days) to perform the Day 30 assessments. If patients are discharged on Days 25-29, the Day 30 assessments may be performed prior to discharge.

Patients will receive another CECT of the abdomen/pancreas at the Day 30 (±5 days) visit. All CECTs performed as standard of care after randomization and before the Day 30 CECT will also be captured. A blinded central reader will read the Screening, Day 30, and any standard of care CECTs obtained between randomization and the Day 30 visit.

    <DETAILED_ELIGIBILITY>Inclusion Criteria:
1.  Has a diagnosis of NMOSD at the time of enrollment according to the 2015 IPND consensus diagnostic criteria for NMOSD&amp;#8224;.
2.  Age 18 years or older at the time of enrollment.
3.  Willing to provide Personal Information.

Exclusion Criteria:
1.  Has had a clinically confirmed NMOSD neuro-episode within the 12 weeks prior to enrollment.
2.  Is participating or planning to participate in a double-blind randomized trial for an NMOSD drug. Note: Concurrent participation in another observational registry or open-label Phase 3b/4 trial is allowed. (All serology types (APQ4 +/- and MOG +/-) are eligible to enroll in the registry given they meet the 2015 IPND diagnostic criteria.)</DETAILED_ELIGIBILITY>
    <DESCRIPTION>The objective of the registry is to create a cohort of patients with NMOSD. Data collected will be used to prospectively study the natural history of NMOSD, real-word effectiveness and safety of medications used to treat NMOSD, and drug utilization treatment patterns. Additionally, the data will be used to systematically evaluate the burden for patients with NMOSD and the impact of therapies on quality of life. This will be done through real time capture and adjudication of relapses, the standardized collection of patient-reported outcomes (PRO) and clinician-reported outcomes (ClinRO), the active evaluation of prevalent and incident comorbidities and adverse events, and the recording of medication utilization patterns.

Personal information is also collected from each consenting registry patient allowing for linkages to other public or private clinical and administrative databases, as well as to databases maintained by organizations focused on the care and treatment of NMOSD for the purposes of clinical, market, or outcomes research. This provides an opportunity to evaluate other aspects of the disease and its treatment including but not limited to clinical and drug cost-effectiveness, health care resource utilization, and patient adherence.

Consent for additional ad hoc surveys will be solicited which can allow evaluation of additional aspects of the disease impact such as care giver burden or impact of disease on productivity.</DESCRIPTION>

    <DESCRIPTION>At an enrollment visit, distance VA will be measured in trial frames with or without cycloplegia based on a cycloplegic refraction performed within 30 days. If still apparently eligible, children will be prescribed spectacles and will then return for a spectacle baseline visit, where they will wear their new spectacles for the first time for at least 10 minutes (but no more than 24 hours) and will be tested in those new spectacles to confirm final eligibility prior to randomization.

Participants not found to be eligible in their new spectacles will end study participation. Participants eligible for the study will be randomly allocated to one of two treatment groups: Sequential (spectacles alone) and then patching if needed (monitored by ODM), or Simultaneous (spectacles and patching monitored by ODM).

After randomization, follow-up visits will occur at 8-week intervals through 56 weeks. At each visit on or after the 8-week visit, participants will be classified as either: stable/worsening or improving; those stable/worsening are then classified as having either resolved or residual amblyopia, provided that the current and most recent previous visit were completed at least 6-weeks apart (target 8 weeks) and provided the required test and retest VA testing was completed. Participants who are stable/worsening and have residual amblyopia in the sequential group will start patching (monitored by ODM) and continue to be followed every 8 weeks. Participants in the simultaneous group, or in the sequential group after having advanced to patching, who are stable/worsening but have residual amblyopia will be released to treatment at investigator discretion.

All participants continue 8-weekly visits until 56 weeks when Study participation ends.</DESCRIPTION>

If both eyes are eligible, then both are included. If one eye is eligible and the other eye has type 1 ROP with ROP or vessels in zone 2, then both eyes will receive the treatment randomly assigned. If one eye is eligible and the fellow eye later develops type 1 ROP within 4 weeks of injection in the first eye, then the fellow eye will also receive the treatment randomly assigned to the first eye and the fellow eye will follow the same 4-week post-injection study exam schedule, unless the first eye has already met failure criteria, in which case treatment and follow-up for the fellow eye is at investigator discretion.

Exclusion Criteria:

Participants meeting any of the following exclusion criteria will be excluded from study participation.

1.  Previous treatment for ROP
2.  Stage 4 or 5 ROP in either eye
3.  Treatment could not be done within 2 days of diagnosis of type 1 ROP
4.  Investigator unwilling to randomize or parent unwilling to accept randomized assignment to either treatment
5.  Transfer to another hospital anticipated within the next 4 weeks where exams by study-certified examiners are not available. If hospital discharge is anticipated within the next 4 weeks, parents unable or unwilling to return to the PEDIG site for outpatient follow-up visits.
6.  Active ocular infection or purulent nasolacrimal duct obstruction in either eye

One eye will be excluded, and other eye may be eligible, if either of the following are present:
1.  Visually significant ocular anomaly (e.g., cataract, coloboma)
2.  Opacity that precludes an adequate view of the retina</DETAILED_ELIGIBILITY>
    <DESCRIPTION>Infants with type 1 ROP and no prior treatment for ROP will be randomly assigned (1:1) to treatment with either intravitreous bevacizumab 0.063 mg or either intravitreous bevacizumab 0.25 mg. Study exams will be at 1 day, 4 days (if no improvement on day 1), 1, 2, 3, and 4 weeks, and at 2 and 4-months post-treatment (and re-treatment when indicated). Additional study exams will occur at adjusted age 6 and 12 months. Non-study examinations will be at clinician discretion and are likely to occur more often. The primary outcome will be treatment success within each dose group, defined as improvement by the day 4 exam and no recurrence of type 1 ROP or severe neovascularization requiring additional treatment within 4 weeks of injection. Important secondary outcomes include safety and efficacy. refractive outcomes, and the extent of retinal vascularization at 2 and 4 months post-injection between the two dose groups.</DESCRIPTION>

    <SUMMARY>Type 1 retinopathy of prematurity in zone I represents the most severe type of ROP and has the worst prognosis. It is unknown whether low-dose bevacizumab will be successful in these severe cases. Also unknown is the timing and extent of peripheral retinal vascularization after low-dose bevacizumab compared with the standard dose. The current study will evaluate whether doses of 0.063 mg and 0.25mg are effective as treatment for type 1 ROP, with ROP and retinal vessels all in zone I.</SUMMARY>

</DETAILED_ELIGIBILITY>
    <DESCRIPTION>N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis is one of the most common causes of autoimmune encephalitis, with prevalence exceeding herpes encephalitis in industrialized nations. Typically, the disease affects patients age 10-50 causing prominent psychiatric symptoms, altered consciousness, seizures, movement disorders and life-threatening dysautonomia. Intensive care, including cardiorespiratory support is required in 75% of cases. The diagnosis is confirmed by detection of IgG autoantibodies against central nervous system NMDAR in the cerebrospinal fluid. Despite the severity of the illness, NMDAR encephalitis is a treatable neurological disease, with retrospective case series establishing the benefit of off-label intravenous steroids and immunoglobulins. These treatments are presumed to work through effects on IgG NMDAR autoantibody levels in the CSF, although prospective data informing predictors of treatment responses are limited. Even with prompt treatment, ~50% of patients remain disabled, requiring prolonged hospital admissions. Various off-label therapies have been proposed as "second-line" treatments in NMDAR encephalitis. The majority of second-line treatments target circulating B-cells with various degrees of blood brain penetrance and efficacy, and poor consensus on the timing, dose and route of delivery of candidate agents. High-quality evidence is needed to inform the treatment of NMDAR encephalitis. Inebilizumab is a promising therapeutic monoclonal antibody for the treatment of NMDAR encephalitis. This humanized monoclonal antibody against the B-cell surface antigen CD19 was recently shown to be safe and efficacious in the treatment of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder-another antibody-mediated disorder of the central nervous system. Compared to other off label B-cell depleting therapies, such as rituximab, inebilizumab not only depletes CD20+ B-cells, but also CD20- plasmablasts and plasma cells, resulting in robust and sustained suppression of B-cell expression. The ExTINGUISH Trial will randomize 116 participants with moderate-to-severe NMDAR encephalitis to receive either inebilizumab or placebo in addition to first-line therapies. Patient outcomes will be ascertained at standard intervals using the modified Rankin scale and accepted safety measures (primary outcomes at 16 weeks), together with comprehensive validated neuropsychological tests, bedside cognitive screening tools, quality of life/ functional indices, and outcome prediction measures. Clinical data will be combined with quantitative measures of NMDAR autoantibody titers and cytokines implicated in B-cell activation and antibody production within the intrathecal compartment to identify treatment responders, inform the biologic contributors to outcomes, and evaluate for biomarkers that may serve as early predictors of favorable outcomes in future clinical trials in NMDAR encephalitis. The ExTINGUISH Trial will prospectively study an optimized B-cell depletion therapy to promote better long-term outcomes in NMDAR encephalitis, to determine more meaningful cognitive endpoints, and to identify better biologic biomarkers to predict outcome.</DESCRIPTION>

    <DESCRIPTION>IIM is considered as a group of rare diseases that is characterized by common features of insidious painless, proximal skeletal muscle weakness, low endurance, and elevated serum muscle enzyme levels. Due to muscle weakness and progressive muscular atrophy, decreasing endurance, internal organ involvement (mainly given the pulmonary, gastrointestinal and cardiac manifestations) and limited therapeutic options, IIM often leads to physical disability and decreased quality of life. Nipocalimab is a fully human aglycosylated immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibody (mAb) designed to selectively bind, saturate, and block the immunoglobulin G (IgG) binding site on the endogenous neonatal fragment crystallizable receptor (FcRn) that binds, salvages, and recycles IgG into circulation or transport IgG across the placenta, following nonspecific pinocytosis into endothelial cells and cells of the reticuloendothelial system. At homeostasis, FcRn recycles IgG to maintain serum IgG levels and extend IgG half-life and also regulates immune cell inflammatory responses to IgG complexes. By targeting the IgG binding site on FcRn, nipocalimab is expected to block the binding and, hence, recycling of IgG, resulting in a decrease in circulating IgG antibody levels, including pathogenic IgG autoantibodies and alloantibodies. Therefore, nipocalimab has potential in the treatment of active IIM by decreasing pathogenic IgG antibody concentrations. The total duration of the study is up to 112 weeks, consisting of 4 study periods: a less than or equal to (&lt;=) 6-week screening period, a 52-week double-blind period, a 48-week long term extension (LTE), and a safety follow-up 8 weeks post last administration of study intervention. Safety assessments include adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), adverse events of special interest (AESIs), laboratory parameters (hematology and chemistry, including lipid panel), vital signs, and physical examination.</DESCRIPTION>

    <SUMMARY>The purpose of this 3-period study is to confirm the efficacy and safety of batoclimab in participants with gMG. In Period 1, participants will be randomized 1:1:1 to receive batoclimab 680 milligrams (mg) subcutaneously (SC) once a week (QW) or 340 mg SC QW or placebo. The primary efficacy endpoint will be assessed by change in the myasthenia gravis activities of daily living (MG- ADL) score in acetylcholine receptor antibody seropositive (AChRAb+) participants. In Period 2, participants previously treated with batoclimab will be re-randomized to stay on batoclimab (340 mg SC QW or 340 mg SC every two weeks) or receive placebo treatment. The secondary endpoint of maintenance of efficacy will be assessed by change in the MG- ADL score in AChRAb+ participants. Participants demonstrating a response to batoclimab during either Period 1 or 2 may enter the long-term extension (Period 3).</SUMMARY>

    <DESCRIPTION>AV-001 is a synthetic Angiopoietin-1 (Angpt-1) mimetic that has been shown to activate the Tie2 receptor tyrosine kinase; a transmembrane protein target most highly expressed on the surface of endothelial cells in the vasculature. The Tie2/Angiopoietin signaling axis has been identified as a nonredundant gatekeeper of vascular homeostasis. In healthy individuals, Tie2 is highly activated and signals the endothelium to fortify intracellular junctions and reduce expression of adhesion molecules, which serve as leukocyte tethers upon inflammation. As such, homeostatic activation results in the promotion of barrier defense against vascular leakage.

The study population for this Phase 2a study will consist of male and non-pregnant female patients, greater than or equal to 18 years of age, hospitalized with presumed pneumonia secondary to SARS-CoV-2 or other viral or bacterial infection with acute onset to a respiratory compromise requiring supplemental oxygen therapy.</DESCRIPTION>

2.  Examine the participants' heart health using an electrocardiogram (ECG)
3.  Take blood samples
4.  Ask the participants questions about how they are feeling and what adverse events they are having.

An adverse event is any medical problem that a participant has during a study. Doctors keep track of all adverse events that happen in studies, even if they do not think the adverse events might be related to the study treatments. In addition, the participants will be asked to complete a questionnaire on quality of life at certain time points during the study.</DESCRIPTION>

    <DESCRIPTION>Understanding the effectiveness of intensive patching has important implications for managing children with IXT. If full-time patching is associated with improvement in distance control vs an observation group, then future studies can be conducted to evaluate different durations of full-time patching treatment, whether the effect is maintained off-treatment, and how full-time patching compares to other treatment strategies.

The purpose of this study is to determine whether full-time patching is more effective than observation for improving distance control of IXT after 3 months of treatment (on-treatment outcome).</DESCRIPTION>

    <DESCRIPTION>In the Phase 2 part of the study, approximately 80 patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio (40 patients receiving active epetraborole tablets and 40 patients receiving matching placebo tablets). The Phase 2 part of the study includes a blinded psychometric analysis plan to assess the psychometric properties of a novel PRO instrument. In addition, symptom-based clinical responses will be assessed using blinded data, to inform the measurement of clinical response in the Phase 3 part of the study.

The Phase 3 part of the study will test the superiority of epetraborole + OBR compared to placebo + OBR. In this part of the study, approximately 234 patients are planned to be randomized in a 2:1 ratio (156 patients receiving active epetraborole tablets and 78 patients receiving matching placebo tablets). The current symptom-based clinical response definition (using the novel PRO) in Phase 3 is a placeholder to be verified after Phase 2 analyses based on data through Month 6. In addition, the Sponsor will determine if the sample size for Phase 3 should be adjusted and will verify the Phase 3 epetraborole dosage regimen based on the observed plasma epetraborole exposure.

Phase 3 data analyses will include a review of patient-reported outcomes, microbiological, safety, and PK data collected at multiple time points through Month 6. Patients in Phase 3 will continue double-blinded study drug for 12 months after the first negative MAC culture that defines sputum culture conversion; study drug will be discontinued in patients who remain MAC culture positive despite 6 months of therapy with study drug.</DESCRIPTION>

    <DESCRIPTION>Overall Design:

Dronedarone is approved by the Food and Drug Administration to reduce the risk of CV hospitalization in patients with AF or atrial flutter. However, it is unknown if dronedarone (or any antiarrhythmic medication) can reduce CV hospitalization or death in patients with first-detected AF. This trial has been designed to address this important question. In order to facilitate the trial enrollment, data collection, and a generalizability to clinical practice, the CHANGE AFIB study has been designed as an open-label pragmatic clinical trial nested within the Get With The Guidelines (GWTG) Atrial Fibrillation registry. At present the overall GWTG program is being implemented in over 2,300 hospitals across the U.S. and is comprised of over 9 million patient records, with an estimated 650,000 new patient records entered per year. The trial will utilize the existing GWTG registry network, data collection architecture, and experience to facilitate both enrollment and conduct of the trial.

The comparator arm will be "usual care." Thus, this study will compare usual care plus dronedarone versus usual care alone. In most patients, the investigators anticipate usual care to include an atrioventricular nodal blocking agent (beta-blocker, non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker, or digoxin) without an antiarrhythmic. As dronedarone has anti-adrenergic rate controlling properties, a low dose of beta-blocker or calcium-channel blocker is recommended in the USPI when starting dronedarone. In the dronedarone arm concomitant digoxin use will be contraindicated due to P-gp interaction based upon data from the PALLAS trial. All patients will receive oral anticoagulation for stroke prevention according to current guideline recommendations.

CHANGE AFIB will leverage several critical advantages as a pragmatic clinical trial. Data collection will be integrated into the Get With The Guidelines AFIB registry. The use of the GWTG-AFIB registry will also enhance subject recruitment and ensure the enrollment of a diverse group of patients. The randomized intervention will be compared with usual care thus further enhancing generalizability. Follow-up visits will be minimized to reduce patient burden. Moreover, follow-up visits will have "windows" to accommodate variation in follow-up intervals at different centers.</DESCRIPTION>

    <DESCRIPTION>This is a multi-center intermediate expanded access program to provide access to the investigational product, CNM-Au8, up to 300 participants diagnosed with ALS.

The safety of CNM-Au8 treatment in ALS participants will be evaluated. Visits will occur at a clinic or remotely via telephone or video-visit. Visits may be conducted remotely due to COVID-19-related pandemic concerns, or if due to ALS disease progression.

Participants who meet the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusionary criteria may be enrolled into the EAP.

There will be three study periods:

1.  A treatment period of forty-eight (48) weeks (Treatment Period 1);
2.  Additional optional follow-on treatment period(s) of up to forty-eight (48) weeks duration may be added at the discretion of the Sponsor and Site Investigator (e.g., Treatment Period 2, Treatment Period 3);
A3.   four (4) week safety follow-up period (End-of-Study [EOS]Assessment).

All participants will receive open-label oral treatment daily up to 48 weeks during Treatment Period 1. Additional 48-week treatment periods may be approved at the discretion of the Sponsor. The EAP may be discontinued at any time at the Sponsor's discretion.

At treatment discontinuation or following the end of the participant's final Treatment Period, participants will complete an end-of-study (EOS) assessment 4 weeks following discontinuation of the investigational drug product.

Visit assessments may be collected remotely, via tele-visit with study site staff. Investigational product may be shipped by the site to participants who do attend in-clinic visits.</DESCRIPTION>

    <SUMMARY>The primary objective of the intermediate expanded access protocol is to provide access to the investigational product, CNM-Au8, to up to 300 people living with ALS (pALS).

No formal clinical hypotheses are being evaluated with concurrent controls.

Secondary objectives include assessment of the safety of CNM-Au8 treatment in pALS. Safety will be assessed through the frequency of serious adverse events (SAEs), treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) assessed as 'severe', discontinuations due to TEAEs, and laboratory abnormalities assessed as clinically significant during routine clinical monitoring (as applicable).</SUMMARY>

    <DESCRIPTION>This is the first in human treatment with ST-920, a recombinant AAV2/6 vector encoding the cDNA for human a-Gal A. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of ascending doses of ST-920. ST-920 aims to provide stable, long-term production of &amp;#945;-Gal A at therapeutic levels in subjects with Fabry disease. The constant production of &amp;#945;-Gal A in humans should, importantly, enable reduction and potentially clearance of Fabry disease substrates Gb3 and lyso-Gb3. On Day 1, patients will be infused intravenously with a single dose of ST-920 and followed for a period of 52 weeks.</DESCRIPTION>

    <DESCRIPTION>LGMD2I/R9 is a rare muscular dystrophy caused by mutations in the FKRP gene that codes for the fukutin-related protein (FKRP), partially responsible for the glycosylation of &amp;#945; dystroglycan (&amp;#945;-DG). Fully glycosylated &amp;#945;-DG is crucial to anchor the actin cytoskeleton of muscle fibers to the extracellular matrix. LION-101 is designed to express the FKRP protein primarily in muscle.</DESCRIPTION>

    <DESCRIPTION>Idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIMs, or myositis) are a group of rare autoimmune diseases characterized by inflammation and muscle weakness. Though the cause of IIM is not well understood, some subtypes of IIM, including dermatomyositis (DM), anti-synthetase syndrome (ASyS), and immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM), are thought to involve B cells that cause the body to attack different tissues in the body. This study is being conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of an investigational cell therapy, CABA-201, that can be given to patients with DM, ASyS, and IMNM who have active disease. A single dose of CABA-201 in combination with cyclophosphamide (CY) and fludarabine (FLU) will be evaluated.</DESCRIPTION>

    <DESCRIPTION>Multiple myeloma is an incurable, malignant, plasma cell disorder. Teclistamab (JNJ-64007957) is a full-size, Immunoglobulin G (IgG) 4 proline, alanine, and alanine (PAA) bispecific antibody that targets the cluster of differentiation (CD3) receptor expressed on the surface of T cells and B cell maturation antigen (BCMA). With its dual binding sites, teclistamab is able to draw CD3 positive T cells in close proximity to BCMA positive cells, resulting in T-cell activation and subsequent lysis of BCMA positive cells. Pomalidomide is a third-generation immunomodulatory imide drug (IMiD) that exerts potent, direct tumoricidal and immune-enhancing effects and Carfilzomib is a second-generation proteasome inhibitor that inhibits proteasome which results in disruption of protein turnover and induces apoptosis. The primary hypothesis of this study is that teclistamab monotherapy (Arm A) will significantly improve progression free survival (PFS) compared with investigator's choice of PVd or Kd (Arm B) in participants with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who have received 1 to 3 prior lines of therapy, including an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody and lenalidomide. The study will include a screening phase, treatment phase, and follow-up phase. Safety will be assessed by physical examinations, neurologic examinations, eastern cooperative oncology group (ECOG) performance status, clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, and AE monitoring. The overall duration of the study will be up to 9 years.</DESCRIPTION>

    <DETAILED_ELIGIBILITY>To be in this study, if you have any tumor type except colorectal cancer you must have a tumor that is positive for expression of the target, B7-H6 via central laboratory testing. If you have colorectal cancer, your tumor will still be tested for B7-H6 by the central laboratory however, you do not need to know the status prior to enrolling. You must have measurable tumors and a tumor that can be biopsied (tumor tissue sample obtained) before study treatment starts and (if you are assigned to certain treatment slots) during study treatment.

You cannot be in this study if you have had major surgery within 28 days. You cannot be in this study if you have or have had a history of an autoimmune disease, are infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), have active hepatitis B or C, or if you chronically abuse alcohol or drugs.

If you received an anti-cancer treatment or investigational study drug recently, you may need to wait up to 21 days (from the last dose of that treatment) before you can receive a first dose of study drug in this study.</DETAILED_ELIGIBILITY>
    <DESCRIPTION>This study is open to adults with advanced solid tumors whose previous cancer treatment was not successful. People can participate if their tumor has the B7-H6 marker or if they have colorectal cancer.

The study tests 2 medicines called BI 765049 and ezabenlimab (BI 754091). Both medicines may help the immune system fight cancer.

The purpose of this study is to find out the highest dose of BI 765049 alone and in combination with ezabenlimab the participants can tolerate. In this study, BI 765049 is given to people for the first time.

Participants can stay in the study for up to 3 years, if they benefit from treatment and can tolerate it. During this time, they get BI 765049 alone or in combination with ezabenlimab as infusion into a vein every 3 weeks.

The doctors check the health of the participants and note any health problems that could have been caused by BI 765049 or ezabenlimab. The doctors also regularly monitor the size of the tumor.</DESCRIPTION>

    <DESCRIPTION>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common cancer worldwide and a leading cause of cancer-related death. The majority of participants first presenting with HCC have advanced unresectable or metastatic disease. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the optimized dose, adverse events, and efficacy of livmoniplimab in combination with budigalimab.

Livmoniplimab is an investigational drug being developed for the treatment of HCC. There are 3 treatment arms in this study and participants will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio. Participants will either receive livmoniplimab (at different doses) in combination with budigalimab (another investigational drug), lenvatinib, or sorafenib. Approximately 120 adult participants will be enrolled in the study across 60 sites worldwide.

In arm 1 (control), participants will receive the investigator's choice: lenvatinib as an oral capsule or sorafenib as an oral tablet, once daily. In arm 2, participants will receive intravenously (IV) infused livmoniplimab (dose A) in combination with IV infused budigalimab, every 3 weeks. In arm 3, participants will receive intravenously (IV) infused livmoniplimab (dose B) in combination with IV infused budigalimab, every 3 weeks. The estimated duration of the study is up to 2 years

There may be higher treatment burden for participants in this trial compared to their standard of care. Participants will attend regular visits during the study at a hospital or clinic and may require frequent medical assessments, blood tests, questionnaires, and scans.</DESCRIPTION>

    <DESCRIPTION>This phase II trial tests whether mosunetuzumab and/or polatuzumab vedotin helps benefit patients who have received chemotherapy (fludarabine and cyclophosphamide) followed by chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy (tisagenlecleucel, axicabtagene ciloleucel, or lisocabtagene maraleucel) for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma that has come back (recurrent) or that does not respond to treatment (refractory) or grade IIIb follicular lymphoma. Mosunetuzumab is a monoclonal antibody that may interfere with the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Polatuzumab vedotin is a monoclonal antibody, called polatuzumab, linked to a drug called vedotin. Polatuzumab is a form of targeted therapy because it attaches to specific molecules (receptors) on the surface of cancer cells, and delivers vedotin to kill them. Chemotherapy drugs, such as fludarabine and cyclophosphamide, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. CAR T-cell therapy is a type of treatment in which a patient's T cells (a type of immune system cell) are changed in the laboratory so they will attack cancer cells. T cells are taken from a patient's blood. Then the gene for a special receptor that binds to a certain protein on the patient's cancer cells is added to the T cells in the laboratory. The special receptor is called a chimeric antigen receptor. Large numbers of the CAR T cells are grown in the laboratory and given to the patient by infusion for treatment of certain cancers. Giving mosunetuzumab and/or polatuzumab vedotin after chemotherapy and CAR T-cell therapy may be more effective at controlling or shrinking the cancer than not giving them.</DESCRIPTION>

    <DESCRIPTION>This phase I trial tests the safety, side effects, and best dose of emavusertib (CA-4948) in combination with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel in treating patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma that has spread from where it first started (primary site) to other places in the body (metastatic) or cannot be removed by surgery (unresectable). CA-4948 is in a class of medications called kinase inhibitors. It works by blocking the action of abnormal proteins called interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 4 (IRAK4) and FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) that signal cells to multiply. This may help keep cancer cells from growing. The usual approach for patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is treatment with chemotherapy drugs gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel. Gemcitabine is a chemotherapy drug that blocks the cells from making DNA and may kill cancer cells. Paclitaxel is in a class of medications called anti-microtubule agents. It stops cancer cells from growing and dividing and may kill them. Nab-paclitaxel is an albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation of paclitaxel which may have fewer side effects and work better than other forms of paclitaxel. Giving CA-4948 in combination with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel may shrink or stabilize metastatic or unresectable pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.</DESCRIPTION>

    <DESCRIPTION>This phase I trial tests the safety, side effects, and best dose of ASTX727 when given together with paclitaxel and pembrolizumab in patients with triple-negative breast cancer that has spread from where it first started (primary site) to other places in the body (metastatic). ASTX727 is a combination of two drugs, decitabine and cedazuridine. Cedazuridine is in a class of medications called cytidine deaminase inhibitors. It prevents the breakdown of decitabine, making it more available in the body so that decitabine will have a greater effect. Decitabine is in a class of medications called hypomethylation agents. It works by helping the bone marrow produce normal blood cells and by killing abnormal cells in the bone marrow. Paclitaxel is in a class of medications called antimicrotubule agents. It stops tumor cells from growing and dividing and may kill them. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving ASTX727 with paclitaxel and pembrolizumab may be able to shrink or stabilize triple negative breast cancer for longer than the usual approach alone.</DESCRIPTION>

    <DESCRIPTION>This phase II trial tests whether decitabine and cedazuridine (ASTX727) in combination with venetoclax work better than ASTX727 alone at decreasing symptoms of bone marrow cancer in patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), myelodysplastic syndrome/myeloproliferative neoplasm (MDS/MPN) with excess blasts. Blasts are immature blood cells. Decitabine is in a class of medications called hypomethylation agents. It works by helping the bone marrow produce normal blood cells and by killing abnormal cells in the bone marrow. Cobimetinib is used in patients whose cancer has a mutated (changed) form of a gene called BRAF. It is in a class of medications called kinase inhibitors. It works by blocking the action of an abnormal protein that signals cancer cells to multiply. This helps slow or stop the spread of cancer cells. Venetoclax is in a class of medications called B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) inhibitors. It may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking Bcl-2, a protein needed for cancer cell survival. The combination of ASTX727 and venetoclax may be more effective in reducing the cancer signs and symptoms in patients with CMML, or MDS/MPN with excess blasts</DESCRIPTION>

    <DESCRIPTION>This phase III trial compares total ablative therapy and usual systemic therapy to usual systemic therapy alone in treating patients with colorectal cancer that has spread to up to 4 body sites (limited metastatic). The usual approach for patients who are not participating in a study is treatment with intravenous (IV) (through a vein) and/or oral medications (systemic therapy) to help stop the cancer sites from getting larger and the spread of the cancer to additional body sites. Ablative means that the intention of the local treatment is to eliminate the cancer at that metastatic site. The ablative local therapy will consist of very focused, intensive radiotherapy called stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) with or without surgical resection and/or microwave ablation, which is a procedure where a needle is temporarily inserted in the tumor and heat is used to destroy the cancer cells. SABR, surgical resection, and microwave ablation have been tested for safety, but it is not scientifically proven that the addition of these treatments are beneficial for your stage of cancer. The addition of ablative local therapy to all known metastatic sites to the usual approach of systemic therapy could shrink or remove the tumor(s) or prevent the tumor(s) from returning.</DESCRIPTION>

    <DESCRIPTION>This phase II trial examines antiandrogen therapy interruptions in patients with hormone-sensitive prostate cancer that has spread to other places in the body (metastatic) responding exceptionally well to androgen receptor-pathway inhibitor therapy. The usual treatment for patients with metastatic prostate cancer is to receive hormonal medications including a medication to decrease testosterone levels in the body and a potent oral hormonal medication to block growth signals from male hormones (like testosterone) in the cancer cells. Patients whose cancer is responding exceptionally well to this therapy may take a break from these medications according to their doctor's guidance. This trial may help doctors determine if stopping treatment can allow for testosterone recovery.</DESCRIPTION>

    <DESCRIPTION>This phase III trial compares the effect of modified fluorouracil, leucovorin calcium, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan (mFOLFIRINOX) to modified fluorouracil, leucovorin calcium, and oxaliplatin (mFOLFOX) for the treatment of advanced, unresectable, or metastatic HER2 negative esophageal, gastroesophageal junction, and gastric adenocarcinoma. The usual approach for patients is treatment with FOLFOX chemotherapy. Chemotherapy drugs work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Fluorouracil stops cells from making DNA and it may kill tumor cells. Leucovorin is used with fluorouracil to enhance the effects of the drug. Oxaliplatin works by killing, stopping, or slowing the growth of tumor cells. Some patients also receive an immunotherapy drug, nivolumab, in addition to FOLFOX chemotherapy. Immunotherapy may induce changes in body's immune system and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Irinotecan blocks certain enzymes needed for cell division and DNA repair, and it may kill tumor cells. Adding irinotecan to the FOLFOX regimen could shrink the cancer and extend the life of patients with advanced gastroesophageal cancers.</DESCRIPTION>

    <DESCRIPTION>The Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) established the Nulliparous Pregnancy Outcomes Study: Monitoring Mothers-to-be (nuMoM2b) to study women for whom the current pregnancy will lead to their first delivery (nulliparas). About 40% of pregnant women in the United States are nulliparas. Because little or no information from previous pregnancy outcomes is available to guide assignment of risk or mitigating interventions, adverse pregnancy outcomes in nulliparas are especially unpredictable. The underlying mechanisms of adverse pregnancy outcomes such as preterm birth, preeclampsia, fetal growth restriction and stillbirth are interrelated and therefore will be evaluated as part of this study. The information gained will benefit women who are pregnant or who are considering pregnancy and their physicians. In addition, the knowledge will support future research aimed at improving care and health outcomes for a critical group of at-risk women who are currently understudied.

The study is a prospective cohort study of a racially/ethnically/geographically diverse population of 10,038 nulliparous women with singleton gestations. The women undergo intensive research assessments during the course of their pregnancies to study the mechanisms for and prediction of adverse pregnancy outcomes (APOs) in women in their first pregnancy. The APOs of primary interest are preterm birth, preeclampsia and fetal growth restriction.

The goals of the study are to 1) determine maternal characteristics, including genetics, epigenetics, and physiological response to pregnancy as well as environmental factors that influence and/or predict adverse pregnancy outcome; 2) identify specific aspects of placental development and function that lead to adverse pregnancy outcome; and 3) characterize genetic, growth, and developmental parameters of the fetus that are associated with adverse pregnancy outcome.

Eight academic medical centers or sites had primary responsibility for enrollment and follow-up of study participants. Several of these sites collected data through additional academic research centers or nearby hospitals (subsites). A Data Coordinating and Analysis Center (DCAC) provided input to the protocol, manages the data, and analyzes the data. Investigators from these institutions have established a partnership with NICHD staff to develop and implement the study protocol and ancillary studies that acquire and analyze data to identify biomarkers and understand the mechanism and prediction of preterm birth and other adverse pregnancy outcomes.</DESCRIPTION>

As a group, they sometimes have complications with their pregnancy, but there is no information from a previous pregnancy to identify who might have a problem. Very little research has been done with this group. The Nulliparous Pregnancy Outcomes Study: Monitoring Mothers-to-be (nuMoM2b) is collecting data from a diverse population of about 10,000 women who are having their first baby and are carrying only one baby. The women are enrolled early in pregnancy and undergo research assessments four times during their pregnancies. Data are collected through interviews, self-completed data forms, clinical measurements, ultrasound, and collection and storage of blood samples, urine samples, and fluid from the vagina and cervix. Some information comes from medical records. A subset of women may be asked to participate in substudies collecting information on sleep breathing, sleep patterns and quality, or other areas possibly related to birth outcomes. The goal of the research is to find ways to identify women in this group who might develop a problem with their pregnancy and use this information to improve the health of pregnant women and their babies in the future. The study is focusing on pregnancy problems like high blood pressure, babies that are born much too early and very small babies.</SUMMARY>

    <SUMMARY>Opioid antagonists at ultra-low doses have been used with opioid agonists to prevent or limit opioid tolerance. Remifentanil, a rapid onset/offset opioid that is often used as an anesthesia adjunct intraoperatively, has been associated with the development of hyperalgesia and opioid tolerance postoperatively. [1-4] Opioid-induced hyperalgesia (OIH) induced by remifentanil intraoperatively may be a factor contributing to an increase in postoperative pain as well as difficulty in controlling such pain. The purpose of this study will be to evaluate whether an ultra-low dose of naloxone, an opioid antagonist, could block remifentanil-induced hyperalgesia and tolerance following surgery.

This research will help elucidate the degree of OIH after surgeries involving remifentanil and determine if a new technique can be employed to decrease remifentanil-induced OIH.  By mitigating OIH, patients should have a decrease in postoperative pain and an increase in patient satisfaction at UCI and other hospitals where such a technique is employed.
