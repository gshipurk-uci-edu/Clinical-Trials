    <STATUS>OPEN TO ACCRUAL</STATUS>
    <ELIGIBILITY>12 Years to 63 Years (Child,  Adult )</ELIGIBILITY>
    <DETAILED_ELIGIBILITY>Inclusion Criteria:
1.  Adult individuals must be &lt; 64 years old at Baseline Visit. Where permitted outside United States (OUS), adolescent individuals who are at least 12 years old at Screening may participate.
2.  Diagnosis of severe alopecia areata (AA) with Severity of Alopecia Tool (SALT) score &gt;= 50 scalp hair loss at Screening and Baseline.
3.  Severe AA with no spontaneous scalp hair regrowth over the past 6 months AND no significant scalp hair loss over the past 3 months.

    <DESCRIPTION>Alopecia areata (AA) is a disease that happens when the immune system attacks hair follicles and causes hair loss. AA usually affects the head and face, but hair loss can happen on any part of the body. The purpose of this study is to assess how safe, effective, and tolerable upadacitinib is in adolescent and adult participants with severe AA.

Upadacitinib is an approved drug being investigated for the treatment of AA. In Study 1 and Study 2 Period A, participants are placed in 1 of 3 groups, called treatment arms. Each group receives a different treatment. There is a 1 in 5 chance that participants will be assigned to placebo. In Study 1 and Study 2 Period B, participants originally randomized to upadacitinib dose group in Period A will continue their same treatment in Period B. Participants originally randomized to Placebo in Period A will either remain on placebo in Period B, or be randomized in 1 of 2 groups, based off of their Severity of Alopecia Tool (SALT) score. Participants who complete Study 1 or Study 2, can join Study 3 and may be re-randomized to receive 1 of 2 doses of upadacitinib for up to 108 weeks. Around 1500 participants with severe AA will be enrolled in the study at approximately 240 sites worldwide.

Participants will receive oral tablets of either upadacitinib or placebo once daily for up to 160 weeks with the potential of being re-randomized into a different treatment group at Weeks 24 and 52. Participants will be followed up for up to 30 days after last study drug dose.

There may be higher treatment burden for participants in this trial compared to their standard of care. Participants will attend regular visits during the study at a hospital or clinic. The effect of the treatment will be checked by medical assessments, blood tests, checking for side effects and completing questionnaires.</DESCRIPTION>

Study ROR-PH-303 is a multicenter, open-label extension (OLE) study for subjects with WHO Group 1 PAH who have participated in another Phase 2 or Phase 3 study of ralinepag and who qualify for entry based upon participation in the prior study. Subjects who discontinue participation in a prior study due to safety issues related to study medication or who fail to complete study procedures will not be eligible to enter Study ROR-PH-303. Subjects who meet all OLE entry criteria will be enrolled and will receive ralinepag in addition to their pre-existing PAH disease-specific background therapy.

For subjects who are enrolled from an ongoing double-blind Phase 2 or Phase 3 ralinepag study, a 16-week blinded Dose Titration Period will be completed following enrollment into the OLE. Subjects previously on ralinepag will continue on the same dose during the Dose Titration Period as received in the original study and will also initiate placebo treatment in the OLE.

Subjects who are enrolled from a non-blinded study or another OLE will not participate in the blinded Dose Titration Period in Study ROR-PH-303 but will be enrolled directly into the Treatment Period and continue on the dose of ralinepag received in the original study.

All subjects will receive ralinepag in the OLE study until premature discontinuation of ralinepag due to an AE/serious adverse event (SAE) or other reason, marketing approval of ralinepag is granted in the region in which the study is conducted, or the study is discontinued by the Sponsor.</DESCRIPTION>

    <DESCRIPTION>This study is designed as a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel group, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of iptacopan (LNP023) in idiopathic immune complex mediated membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis.

The purpose of this Phase III study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of iptacopan compared to placebo (both administered in combination with standard of care) in participants (adults and adolescents aged 12-17 years) with idiopathic IC-MPGN. The study aims to demonstrate a reduction in proteinuria and improvement in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in participants treated with iptacopan compared to placebo. Change in patient-reported fatigue will also be evaluated. Alternative complement pathway (AP) dysregulation is believed to underlie the clinical manifestations and progression of IC-MPGN. Upon completion of study treatment, participants will have the option to discontinue iptacopan treatment and enter a 30 day safety follow-up or continue iptacopan treatment by transitioning to an open label extension study (CLNP023B12001B; NCT03955445) and continue iptacopan treatment.</DESCRIPTION>

    <DESCRIPTION>REVERXaL study aims to increase the understanding of the patient characteristics, bleeding presentation, health care interventions provided, and the clinical as well as self-reported health outcomes of patients with major bleeding in the presence of Factor Xa inhibitor treatment. The generation of insight on treatment approaches and associated outcomes in hospitalized patients with Factor Xa inhibitor-related major bleeds may inform clinical guidelines, health system decision making and streamline treatment pathways in this population.

REVERXaL is a multinational observational study incorporating 2 patient cohorts (historical and prospective) with major bleeds during Factor Xa inhibitor use. This study will be mainly descriptive in nature without any pre-specified statistical hypotheses. Variables will be collected according to routine medical practice either through primary data collection directly from patients, or from secondary data collection via data extraction from electronic or paper medical records into electronic case report forms (eCRFs). Patients will undergo clinical assessments and receive standard medical care as determined by their treating physicians. Patients will not receive any experimental disease management intervention or experimental treatment because of their participation in the study. As part of routine care, study investigators will evaluate patients about their medical history, medication history, bleeding presentation, and any adverse event (AE) or severe adverse event (SAE) experiences since the previous clinical visit and the related information. No additional or pre-defined site visits will be scheduled outside of the patient's routine clinical visits.</DESCRIPTION>

Please note this may not be a complete list of eligibility criteria. We have included a few examples of study criteria to help you better understand how your eligibility in the study will be determined; your study team will go through the study eligibility criteria with you to verify if you qualify for participation in this study.

Exclusion Requirements
You cannot participate in this study if you are pregnant.</DETAILED_ELIGIBILITY>
    <DESCRIPTION>UC Irvine Medical Center is both a treatment and a research hospital. As a patient here, you may be treated
by some doctors who are also researchers performing studies to improve treatments currently available.

Scientists and clinicians at this institution are working together to discover new ways to treat cancer and
new ways to make current treatments safer and more effective. In order to conduct this research, we need
to study samples of normal and disease tissue obtained from normal volunteers and our patients. In order
to minimize the discomfort and risk to subjects, we are seeking to collect tissue that is left over from studies
that are required for your evaluation and care and are already being done. In certain circumstances (blood
draw and bone marrow aspiration) we are seeking to collect a small amount of tissue in addition to the
sample that would be collected for your routine care. Except for giving samples of blood, you will not be
asked to undergo any procedure solely for the purpose of obtaining a sample for this study. 

You are being asked to take part in this research study because you have or are being evaluated for a
hematologic malignancy, bone marrow disorder, or immune system disorder.

This research study involves the collection and storage of blood and other tissue for later research testing.
It is not currently known how samples donated to the repository will be used at this time. These research tests may be developed during the time you are a patient at UC Irvine Medical Center, or in some cases, years later. Any researcher at UCI or their collaborators (including for-profit entities) may request permission to use samples from the repository. Frozen de-identified samples will be provided to researchers after their plans have been evaluated and approved by the UCI review board that oversees human research (IRB). These tests may provide additional information that will be helpful in understanding cancer and other diseases, but it is unlikely that what we learn from these studies will benefit you directly.

These studies may benefit other patients in the future. The research performed on these samples may
include the study of genetics, including the subject&amp;#8217;s DNA code, parts or the DNA code or even whole
genome sequencing. Samples from the repository will not be used to create cell lines.

&amp;#8226;	Are a male or female subject, 18 years of age or older 
&amp;#8226;	Are able to adhere to the study visit schedule and other protocol requirements
&amp;#8226;	Have a confirmed diagnosis of locally advanced or metastatic solid tumor that has a specific gene rearrangement

Exclusion Requirements 
You cannot participate in this study if you
&amp;#8226;	Are pregnant or breastfeeding, or intending to become pregnant during the study 
&amp;#8226;	Are currently participating in another therapeutic clinical trial
&amp;#8226;	Have a known active infection (bacterial, fungal, or viral, including human immunodeficiency virus positivity).</DETAILED_ELIGIBILITY>
    <DESCRIPTION>This study has 2 parts (Phase 1 and Phase 2): 
&amp;#8226;	Phase 1: Phase 1 of this research study is currently ongoing. It was the first time that the study drug, reprotrectinib, was given to humans.
o	The purpose of Phase 1 was to determine the dose of repotrectinib to use in Phase 2 of the study.  Phase 1 look at the side effects and response of tumors to different doses of repotrectinib. Phase 1 also looked at how different foods affect how repotrectinib gets into the body. Phase 1 includes the following sub-studies:
&amp;#61607;	Phase 1a, where the study drug is given under fasting conditions. You will need to fast 1 hour before and 2 hours after study drug administration. As of November 5th 2018, this part of the study is completed and will not enroll any new subjects
&amp;#61607;	Phase 1b is a Food Effect Sub-Study (a study within a study). You may be asked to participate in the Food Effect Sub-Study. The purpose of the Food Effect Sub-Study is to determine the effect of high-fat, high-calorie food on a single dose of repotrectinib (how much and how fast repotrectinib gets into the body after a meal). As of November 5th 2018, this part of the study is completed and will not enroll any new subjects.
&amp;#61607;	Phase 1 also includes a study of repotrectinib when administered continuously with food, where you will take every dose of the study drug with a standard meal, called Phase 1c. 
&amp;#8226;	Phase 2: You are being asked to participate in Phase 2 of this study (not Phase 1). The purpose of Phase 2 is to determine, more specifically, whether repotrectinib works, especially in groups of subjects who have the various tumor gene rearrangements mentioned above. Phase 2 will also continue to look at the side effects as well as how repotrectinib is absorbed into the body.
The Phase 2 portion of the study will evaluate the anti-cancer activity of repotrectinib at the dose listed below:
&amp;#8226;	160 mg once a day for 14 days that may increase to 160 mg twice a day based on the drug&amp;#8217;s tolerability 
The study doctor will assess and decide if your dose should be increased or decreased.
 No study procedures related to this study will be performed until you have signed this Informed Consent Form. A copy of the signed Informed Consent Form will be given to you to keep.</DESCRIPTION>

    <DETAILED_ELIGIBILITY>Eligibility Criteria:

- Patient must have diagnosed anal cancer with tumors measuring less than or equal to 4 cm within 4 weeks prior to registration. 
- Patient's tumor size must be documented on physical examination including digital rectal exam and/or anoscopy/proctoscopy within 4 weeks prior to Step 0 pre-registration.
- Patient must have no history of prior radiation or chemotherapy for carcinoma of the anus.
- Patient must not have had prior potentially curative surgery (i.e. abdominal-perineal resection) for carcinoma of the anus.</DETAILED_ELIGIBILITY>
    <DESCRIPTION>This phase II trial studies how well lower-dose chemotherapy plus radiation (chemoradiation) therapy works in comparison to standard-dose chemoradiation in treating patients with early-stage anal cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as mitomycin, fluorouracil, and capecitabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Giving chemotherapy with radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells. This study may help doctors find out if lower-dose chemoradiation is as effective and has fewer side effects than standard-dose chemoradiation, which is the usual approach for treatment of this cancer type.</DESCRIPTION>

    <DESCRIPTION>This phase I/II trial studies the best dose and side effects of peposertib and to see how well it works with avelumab and hypofractionated radiation therapy in treating patients with solid tumors and hepatobiliary malignancies that have spread to other places in the body (advanced/metastatic). Peposertib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as avelumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Hypofractionated radiation therapy delivers higher doses of radiation therapy over a shorter period of time and may kill more tumor cells and have fewer side effects. Giving peposertib in combination with avelumab and hypofractionated radiation therapy may work better than other standard chemotherapy, hormonal, targeted, or immunotherapy medicines available in treating patients with solid tumors and hepatobiliary malignancies.</DESCRIPTION>

    <DETAILED_ELIGIBILITY>Inclusion Criteria:
- Unless a patient has had orchiectomy by surgery, the patient is expected to be on antiandrogen therapy (ADT) for "medical castration". ADT needs to be maintained throughout the study. Testosterone level should be checked, and kept consistently lower than 50 ng/dL, similar to that obtained with bilateral orchiectomy
- Progression after at least one of the following: abiraterone, enzalutamide, apalutamide, darolutamide, or taxane chemotherapy (docetaxel, cabazitaxel). There is no maximum number of prior therapies

Exclusion Criteria: 
- Active autoimmune conditions or patients on chronic immunosuppression due to underlying autoimmune condition
- Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks prior to entering the study
- Patients who have not recovered from adverse events due to prior anti-cancer therapy (i.e., have residual toxicities &gt; grade 1) with the exception of alopecia
- Prior therapy with radionuclides (e.g., strontium, samarium, rhenium, radium)

    <DESCRIPTION>This phase I/II trial studies the best dose of M3814 when given together with radium-223 dichloride or with radium-223 dichloride and avelumab and to see how well they work in treating patients with castrate-resistant prostate cancer that had spread to other places in the body (metastatic). M3814 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Radioactive drugs, such as radium-223 dichloride, may carry radiation directly to tumor cells and not harm normal cells. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as avelumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. This study is being done to find out the better treatment between radium-223 dichloride alone, radium-223 dichloride in combination with M3814, or radium-223 dichloride in combination with both M3814 and avelumab, to lower the chance of prostate cancer growing or spreading in the bone, and if this approach is better or worse than the usual approach for advanced prostate cancer not responsive to hormonal therapy.</DESCRIPTION>

    <DESCRIPTION>This phase III trial compares the effect of usual treatment of chemotherapy and steroids and a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) to the same treatment plus blinatumomab. Blinatumomab is a Bi-specific T-Cell Engager ('BiTE') that may interfere with the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. The information gained from this study may help researchers determine if combination therapy with steroids, TKIs, and blinatumomab work better than the standard of care.</DESCRIPTION>

    <DESCRIPTION>This phase III trial compares early treatment with venetoclax and obinutuzumab versus delayed treatment with venetoclax and obinutuzumab in patients with newly diagnosed high-risk chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma. Venetoclax may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as obinutuzumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Starting treatment with the venetoclax and obinutuzumab early (before patients have symptoms) may have better outcomes for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma compared to starting treatment with the venetoclax and obinutuzumab after patients show symptoms.</DESCRIPTION>

    <DETAILED_ELIGIBILITY>Inclusion Criteria:
-HER2-positive status will be based on pretreatment biopsy material and defined as an immunohistochemistry (IHC) score of 3+ and/or positive by in situ hybridization (ISH) according to current American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) College of American Pathologists (CAP) guidelines. Central testing is not required
* Known hormone receptor (HR) status as defined by ASCO/CAP guidelines (based on pretreatment biopsy material). Hormone receptor positive status can be determined by either known positive estrogen receptor (ER) or known positive progesterone receptor (PR) status; hormone receptor negative status must be determined by both known negative ER and known negative PR
-Patients with clinical stage T1-4, N0-3 disease at presentation and residual invasive disease postoperatively as defined above are eligible. (Note: Patients with T1a/bN0 tumors are not eligible at initial breast cancer diagnosis are not eligible)
-Patients with residual HR-negative, HER2 positive (+) disease in the breast and/or lymph nodes per the surgical pathology report are eligible; however, patients with HR+ HER2+ cancers must have node-positive residual disease per the surgical pathology report in order to qualify for the study. The presence of residual invasive disease in the breast is not mandatory for these patients
-Patients with weakly ER-positive (1-10%) breast cancer (based on the pretreatment core biopsy) are eligible even if they have node-negative disease per the surgical pathology report
-The residual disease tissue (breast and/or lymph nodes) is not required to be HER2-positive, as eligibility for NCI-2020-03770 (A011801) is based on a positive HER2 status at the time of the initial breast cancer diagnosis
* Note: The presence of micrometastases in lymph nodes after preoperative therapy counts as residual disease, whereas the presence of isolated tumor cells does not

Exclusion Criteria:
-No adjuvant treatment with any anti-cancer investigational drug within 28 days prior to registration
-Not pregnant and not nursing, because this study involves an agent that has known genotoxic, mutagenic and teratogenic effects. Therefore, for women of childbearing potential only, a negative serum pregnancy test done =&lt; 7 days prior to registration is required
-Patients with known active and/or untreated hepatitis B or hepatitis C or chronic liver disease are ineligible. Patients with a diagnosis of hepatitis B or C that has been treated and cleared and normal liver function are eligible to participate in the study if the other eligibility parameters are met</DETAILED_ELIGIBILITY>
    <DESCRIPTION>This phase III trial studies how well trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) and tucatinib work in preventing breast cancer from coming back (relapsing) in patients with high risk, HER2 positive breast cancer. T-DM1 is a monoclonal antibody, called trastuzumab, linked to a chemotherapy drug, called DM1. Trastuzumab is a form of targeted therapy because it attaches to specific molecules (receptors) on the surface of cancer cells, known as HER2 receptors, and delivers DM1 to kill them. Tucatinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving T-DM1 and tucatinib may work better in preventing breast cancer from relapsing in patients with HER2 positive breast cancer compared to T-DM1 alone.</DESCRIPTION>

    <DESCRIPTION>This study will test an experimental drug (enfortumab vedotin) alone and with different combinations of anticancer therapies. Pembrolizumab is an immune checkpoint inhibitor (CPI) that is used to treat patients with cancer of the urinary system (urothelial cancer). This type of cancer includes cancer of the bladder, renal pelvis, ureter or urethra. Some parts of the study will look at locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer (la/mUC), which means the cancer has spread to nearby tissues or to other areas of the body. Other parts of the study will look at muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC), which is cancer at an earlier stage that has spread into the muscle wall of the bladder. This study will look at the side effects of enfortumab vedotin alone and with other anticancer therapies. A side effect is a response to a drug that is not part of the treatment effect. This study will also test if the cancer shrinks with the different treatment combinations.</DESCRIPTION>

    <DESCRIPTION>Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common cancer seen in pediatric oncology. The necessary chemotherapy for pediatric and adolescent and young adult (AYA) patients with ALL includes steroids, anthracyclines, asparaginase, and vincristine. One of the most hepatotoxic chemotherapy agents is asparaginase, with treatment-associated hepatotoxicity (TAH) observed in up to 60% of patients. The frequency of TAH is increased in overweight or obese patients of Latino heritage. Carnitine is a naturally-derived compound that is produced in the liver and kidneys; it is found in certain foods, such as meat, poultry, fish, and some dairy products. Endogenous carnitine transports long-chain fatty acids into the mitochondria, where they are oxidized to produce energy, and acts as scavengers of oxygen free radicals. Thus, carnitine can reduce oxidative stress and modulate inflammatory response. Levocarnitine is a supplement form of carnitine used typically in the care and management of patients with carnitine deficiency. Pediatric and AYAs with ALL will be given oral levocarnitine as a supplement during their initial phases of treatment, when the most hepatotoxic agents are administered, to determine if the incidence of liver toxicity can be reduced or eliminated.

    <DESCRIPTION>This phase II/III trial studies the side effects of nivolumab and ipilimumab when given together with or without sargramostim and to see how well they work in treating patients with stage III-IV melanoma that cannot be removed by surgery (unresectable). Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as ipilimumab and nivolumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Colony-stimulating factors, such as sargramostim, may increase the production of white blood cells. It is not yet known whether nivolumab and ipilimumab are more effective with or without sargramostim in treating patients with melanoma.</DESCRIPTION>

    <DESCRIPTION>This trial studies how well atezolizumab added to the usual radiation therapy works in treating patients with stage I-IIA non-small cell lung cancer. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as atezolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Radiation therapy, such as stereotactic body radiation therapy, uses special equipment to position a patient and deliver radiation to tumors with high precision. This method can kill tumor cells with fewer doses over a shorter period and cause less damage to normal tissue. Giving atezolizumab and radiation therapy may work better than radiation therapy alone in treating patients with early non-small cell lung cancer.</DESCRIPTION>

- Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC or other solid tumors.
- Evidence of ROS1 fusion in tumor tissue determined by molecular assays as performed in Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-certified or locally equivalent laboratories.
- Patients with central nervous system (CNS) involvement, including leptomeningeal carcinomatosis, which is either asymptomatic or previously treated and controlled, are allowed; the use of seizure prophylaxis is allowed as long as patients are taking non enzyme inducing anti-epileptic drugs (non-EIAEDs). If corticosteroid treatment is required, it should be on stable or decreasing dose of &amp;#8804;10 mg prednisone or equivalent. If patients have neurological symptoms or signs due to CNS metastasis, patients need to complete whole brain radiation or gamma knife irradiation treatment at least 14 days before enrollment and be clinically stable.
- The patient is either ROS1 TKI treatment naÃ¯ve, or treated with prior ROS1 TKI(s).
Exclusion:
- Investigational agent or anticancer therapy within 2 weeks (or 5 half-lives of the compound, whichever is longer) prior to study enrollment. In addition, no concurrent anticancer therapy is permitted.
- Previously treated with immuno-oncology (IO) including immune checkpoint inhibitors within 12 weeks before enrollment.
- Major surgery within 4 weeks prior to enrollment.
- Radiation therapy with a limited field for palliation within 1 week of the first dose of study treatment.
- Toxicities due to prior therapy are unresolved to &amp;#8804; CTCAE 5.0 Grade 1 except for AEs not constituting a safety risk to the patient based on the judgment of investigators.</DETAILED_ELIGIBILITY>
    <DESCRIPTION>This is a global Phase 2, multicenter, single-arm, open label study of taletrectinib in patients of NSCLC harboring with ROS1 fusion gene.

119 patients will be enrolled and divided into 4 cohorts, depending on past history of ROS1 TKI treatment.

Taletrectinib will be administered 600mg once daily in 21-day cycles. Patients will continue with the study treatment until progression of disease as determined by the investigator.

The tumor response evaluation will be conducted on a regular basis until progression of disease. Long-term survival follow up will be conducted as well.</DESCRIPTION>

    <DESCRIPTION>This phase III trial compares the effects of nivolumab with chemo-immunotherapy versus chemo-immunotherapy alone in treating patients with newly diagnosed primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL). Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Treatment for PMBCL involves chemotherapy combined with an immunotherapy called rituximab. Chemotherapy drugs work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody. It binds to a protein called CD20, which is found on B cells (a type of white blood cell) and some types of cancer cells. This may help the immune system kill cancer cells. Giving nivolumab with chemo-immunotherapy may help treat patients with PMBCL.</DESCRIPTION>

Exclusion Criteria: 
- Prior systemic chemotherapy within =&lt; 3 years prior to registration; note that prior chemotherapy for a different cancer is allowed (completed &gt; 3 years prior to registration)
- Prior radical prostatectomy
- Prior radiotherapy to the region of the study cancer that would result in overlap of radiation therapy fields</DETAILED_ELIGIBILITY>
    <DESCRIPTION>This phase III trial compares less intense hormone therapy and radiation therapy to usual hormone therapy and radiation therapy in treating patients with high risk prostate cancer and low gene risk score. This trial also compares more intense hormone therapy and radiation therapy to usual hormone therapy and radiation therapy in patients with high risk prostate cancer and high gene risk score. Apalutamide may help fight prostate cancer by blocking the use of androgen by the tumor cells. Radiation therapy uses high energy rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Giving a shorter hormone therapy treatment may work the same at controlling prostate cancer compared to the usual 24 month hormone therapy treatment in patients with low gene risk score. Adding apalutamide to the usual treatment may increase the length of time without prostate cancer spreading as compared to the usual treatment in patients with high gene risk score.</DESCRIPTION>

However, there is a chance you still may not be able to participate. You will need to go through tests and procedures to see if you meet all the requirements to take part in this study.
You will not be able to take part in this study if you:
- have certain medical conditions that would limit your compliance with study requirements or impact your safety by participation in this study
- have received certain treatments for AML,
- require treatment with concomitant drugs that are strong inducers CYP3A or P-gp during study,

    <DESCRIPTION>People with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are usually treated with chemotherapy. Some people with AML have a changed FLT3 gene which causes leukemia cells to grow faster. Therefore, chemotherapy is less suitable to treat AML in people with the changed FLT3 gene.

Gilteritinib, given with venetoclax and azacitidine, is a potential new treatment for people with AML with the changed FLT3 gene. They cannot have chemotherapy due to old age or other conditions. Before these combined 3 medicines are available as a treatment, the researchers need to understand how they are processed by and act upon the body when given together. In this study, they do this to find a suitable dose for venetoclax and to check for potential medical problems from the treatment.</DESCRIPTION>

    <DETAILED_ELIGIBILITY>Eligibility Criteria:

- Patient must have histological or cytological diagnosis of pancreatic adenocarinoma.
- Patient must have one of the following mutations: germline mutation in BRCA 1 or 2 from a CLIA certified lab defined as positive and/or deleterious (pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant).
- Patient must have metastatic disease and received first line platinum-based chemotherapy (i.e. FOLFIRINOX, FOLOFX, gemcitabine + nab-paclitaxel + cisplatin or gemcitabine + cisplatin). </DETAILED_ELIGIBILITY>
    <DESCRIPTION>The purpose of this study is to compare the usual treatment (olaparib) alone to using pembrolizumab plus the usual treatment.  The addition of pembrolizumab to the usual treatment could help to shrink your cancer   but, it could also cause side effects. This study will help the study doctors find out if this different approach is  better, the same, or worse than the usual approach.  To decide if it is better, the study doctors will be looking to see if the study drug pembrolizumab increases the time it takes for the cancer to grow  by 5 months or more compared to the usual approach.  

Olaparib alone has been approved as maintenance therapy for patients with germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutated pancreatic cancer. </DESCRIPTION>

Hemoglobin &gt; 9.0 g/dL (unsupported, no transfusion within 7 days of enrollment).
You have acceptable coagulation parameters (anti-coagulation allowed) defined as:
International normalized ratio less than or equal to 2 x ULN unless on anticoagulation or prothrombin time within normal limits.
Activated partial thromboplastin time within normal limits.
You have a negative serum pregnancy test result at screening (females of childbearing potential [FCBP] only). Not applicable to participants who are surgically sterile (i.e., bilateral salpingectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or complete hysterectomy) or who are post-menopausal. Women will be considered post-menopausal if they have been amenorrheic for 12 months without an alternative medical cause.
Contraceptive use by men and women must be consistent with local regulations regarding the methods of contraception for those participating in clinical studies. FCBP whose partner(s) are non-sterilized males and non-sterilized male participants whose sexual partner(s) are FCBP must abstain from heterosexual activity or agree to use an acceptable method of contraception according to the following guidelines:
The reliability of sexual abstinence for male and/or female enrollment eligibility needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the entire period of risk associated with study interventions and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant. Total sexual abstinence is an acceptable method provided it is the usual lifestyle of the participant. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or post ovulation methods), the rhythm method, and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.
Non-sterilized Male Participants:
Must use an acceptable method of contraception such as male condom plus spermicide during the entire period of risk associated with study interventions which includes the total duration of the study and the drug washout period (6 months after the last dose of study intervention) and refrain from sperm donation or banking throughout this period.</DETAILED_ELIGIBILITY>
    <DESCRIPTION>The study will assess the safety and efficacy of BXQ-350 plus modified FOLFOX7 (mFOLFOX7) and bevacizumab in participants who have newly diagnosed metastatic adenocarcinoma of the colon/rectum. The study will also evaluate if the administration of BXQ-350 with mFOLFOX7 and bevacizumab may diminish oxaliplatin induced sensory neurotoxicity, enabling participants to receive the total and planned doses of mFOLFOX7.</DESCRIPTION>

- Prior antitumor treatment (including chemotherapy, radiotherapy, targeted therapy, immunotherapy etc.) within 2 weeks of start of study
- Major surgery that has not fully recovered within 4 weeks prior to dose administration</DETAILED_ELIGIBILITY>
    <DESCRIPTION>This study is being done to see if a drug called disitamab vedotin, alone or with pembrolizumab, works to treat HER2 expressing urothelial cancer. It will also test how safe the drug is for participants.

Participants will have cancer that has spread in the body near where it started (locally advanced) and cannot be removed (unresectable) or has spread through the body (metastatic).

It will also study what side effects happen when participants get the drug. A side effect is anything a drug does to your body besides treating the disease.</DESCRIPTION>

    <ELIGIBILITY>People invited into this study are males and females with NMIBC that have never received BCG treatments, did not complete BCG treatments, has not responded to, or has lost their response to BCG treatments, 18 years of age or older, and meet other criteria of the study. </ELIGIBILITY>
    <DETAILED_ELIGIBILITY>7.1.1. Patient Inclusion Criteria 
Patients who have signed and dated an approved informed consent form (ICF) and meet all of the 
following criteria will be considered eligible for this study: 
BCG-Unresponsive Patients (Phase 1 and Phase 2-Cohort 1): 
1. BCG-unresponsive NMIBC with Cis of the bladder, with or without coexisting papillary 
Ta/T1 tumor(s) who are ineligible for or have elected not to undergo cystectomy, and 
have experienced 1) persistent disease within 12 months of treatment or 2) a recurrence 
within 6 months of completion of adequate BCG therapy, where: 
- Adequate BCG regimen consists of at least 2 courses of BCG where the first course 
(induction) must have included at least 5 or 6 doses and the second course may have 
included a re-induction (at least 2 of 6 treatments) or maintenance (at least 2 of 
3 doses), 
- Patients with BCG-unresponsive NMIBC may have received subsequent approved 
treatment for NMIBC that discontinued no more than 4 months of Screening, and 
- Cis must be documented or indicated by pathology at Screening or within 4 months of 
Screening (provided no therapy for Cis disease was given after the most 
recent biopsy). 
BCG-NaÃ¯ve or BCG-Incompletely Treated Patients (Phase 2-Cohort 2 Only): 
2. NMIBC with current Cis of the bladder, with or without coexisting papillary Ta/T1 
NMIBC tumor(s), who are ineligible for or have elected not to undergo 
cystectomy where: 
- Either: a) incomplete BCG (at least 1 dose) treatment or b) no treatment with BCG 
due to unavailability, but who have previously been treated with at least 1 dose of 
intravesical chemotherapy following transurethral resection of bladder 
tumor (TURBT), and

    <DESCRIPTION>EG-70 is a nanoparticle containing the pDNA drug substance (N9-h12-R) packaged in a modified chitosan-based polymer called RXG and further combined with a PEG-b-PLE diblock copolymer. RXG and PEG-b-PLE are both novel excipients. The product is formulated as an aqueous nanoparticle dispersion in mannitol solution, filter sterilized andlyophilized to a dry powder. 

The specific properties and ratios of the pDNA, RXG, PEG-b-PLE, and mannitol excipients were chosen as a result of screening experiments focused on physiochemical characteristics, stability, and biological potency in a mouse model. Each single-dose vial of the drug product will be rehydrated with sterile water for injection (sWFI) or sterile water for irrigation at the clinical site prior to administration to the patient via intra-urethral catheter delivery.</DESCRIPTION>

-Patients must be 18 years of age or older
-Patients must have confirmed T2 or T3 gallbladder cancer discovered incidentally at the time of or following routine cholecystectomy for presumed benign disease.
-Patients must have undergone initial cholecystectomy within 12 weeks</DETAILED_ELIGIBILITY>
    <DESCRIPTION>This phase II/III trial compares the effect of adding chemotherapy before and after surgery versus after surgery alone (usual treatment) in treating patients with stage II-III gallbladder cancer. Chemotherapy drugs, such as gemcitabine and cisplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving chemotherapy before surgery may make the tumor smaller; therefore, may reduce the extent of surgery. Additionally, it may make it easier for the surgeon to distinguish between normal and cancerous tissue. Giving chemotherapy after surgery may kill any remaining tumor cells. This study will determine whether giving chemotherapy before surgery increases the length of time before the cancer may return and whether it will increase a patient's life span compared to the usual approach.</DESCRIPTION>

- Prior metastatic or non-metastatic, invasive malignancy (except non metastatic, non-melanomatous skin cancer) unless continuously disease free for &gt;= 3 years
- Prior chemotherapy for prostate cancer or bilateral orchiectomy</DETAILED_ELIGIBILITY>
    <DESCRIPTION>This phase II trial tests whether relugolix and radiation therapy works to shrink tumors in patients with prostate cancer that has spread in a limited way to 1 to 5 other parts of the body (oligometastatic). Testosterone can cause the growth of prostate cancer cells. Relugolix lowers the amount of testosterone made by the body. This may help stop the growth of tumor cells that need testosterone to grow. Giving relugolix with radiation therapy may help lower the chance of prostate cancer growing or spreading.</DESCRIPTION>

    <DETAILED_ELIGIBILITY>Inclusion Criteria:
You must have a histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the colon or rectum. The date of diagnosis will be determined according to the pathologic date of diagnosis
You must have measurable disease according to RECIST1.1 criteria. Computed tomography (CT) scans or magnetic resonance imaging (MRIs) used to assess measurable disease must have been completed within 28 days prior to registration. CT scans or MRIs used to assess non-measurable disease must have been completed within 42 days prior to registration. All disease must be assessed and documented on the Baseline Tumor Assessment Form
You must have documented unresectable and/or metastatic disease on CT or MRI imaging. All disease must be assessed and documented on the Baseline Tumor Assessment Form
You must have BRAF^V600E mutated colorectal cancer as tested in a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act (CLIA)-certified laboratory
You must have proficient mismatch repair (pMMR) or microsatellite stable (MSS) status as tested in a CLIA-certified laboratory and documented by the treating clinician. Proficient mismatch repair status can be determined by intact expression by immunohistochemistry of all 4 mismatch repair proteins (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2). Microsatellite instability can be determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)

Exclusion Criteria:
You must not have a known positive serology for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Encorafenib is contraindicated with concomitant use of non-nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitors like efavirenz and etravirine. In addition, it is recommended in the investigator brochure of encorafenib to avoid using encorafenib with protease inhibitors. Therefore, because all participants on this study would receive encorafenib for either randomized arm of treatment, participants with HIV who receive these components of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) would be at high risk for complications of drug-drug interaction
You must not have had prior treatment with a BRAF inhibitor (including, but not limited to, encorafenib, dabrafenib, or vemurafenib), MEK inhibitor (including, but not limited to, trametinib, selumetinib, or binimetinib), or ERK inhibitor (of note, regorafenib is not considered a BRAF inhibitor for the context of eligibility criteria)
You must not have had prior treatment with anti-EGFR therapies
You must not have had prior treatment with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, anti-PD-L2, anti-CTLA-4 antibody, or any other antibody or drug specifically targeting T-cell co-stimulation or immune checkpoint pathways</DETAILED_ELIGIBILITY>
    <DESCRIPTION>This phase II trial tests whether adding nivolumab to the usual treatment (encorafenib and cetuximab) works better than the usual treatment alone to shrink tumors in patients with colorectal cancer that has spread to other places in the body (metastatic) or that cannot be removed by surgery (unresectable) and whose tumor has a mutation in a gene called BRAF. Encorafenib is in a class of medications called kinase inhibitors. It is used in patients whose cancer has a certain mutation (change) in the BRAF gene. It works by blocking the action of mutated BRAF that signals cancer cells to multiply. This helps to stop or slow the spread of cancer cells. Cetuximab is in a class of medications called monoclonal antibodies. It binds to a protein called EGFR, which is found on some types of cancer cells. This may help keep cancer cells from growing. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving nivolumab in combination with encorafenib and cetuximab may be more effective than encorafenib and cetuximab alone at stopping tumor growth and spreading in patients with metastatic or unresectable BRAF-mutant colorectal cancer.

    <DESCRIPTION>We are enrolling cancer of the blood and bone marrow patients. In this study, we are looking at a new investigational drug called LYT-200 that is intended to inhibit (hinder) galectin-9. Galectin-9 is a protein which suppresses immune functionand disables immune-mediated attack on the cancer cells through multiple pathways. At present, there are no approved therapies targeting galectin-9 for any disease. Early studies conducted in 
animals suggest LYT-200 might be a good treatment for patients with blood and bone marrow 
cancer.
This study is among the first research studies of LYT-200 in people and its main purpose is to 
test its safety and tolerability in patients suffering from two types of blood and bone marrow 
cancer: acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). In this study we 
shall also examine how the drug is changed by and removed from the body and will look for 
signs that the drug may be effective against AML or MDS. LYT-200 will be tested at several 
different doses.

    <DESCRIPTION>This phase III trial compares the effect of adding lomustine to temozolomide and radiation therapy versus temozolomide and radiation therapy alone in shrinking or stabilizing newly diagnosed MGMT methylated glioblastoma. Chemotherapy drugs, such as lomustine and temozolomide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Radiation therapy uses high energy photons to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Adding lomustine to usual treatment of temozolomide and radiation therapy may help shrink and stabilize glioblastoma.</DESCRIPTION>

    <DESCRIPTION>The investigators will perform a global, Phase III, randomized, double-blind controlled trial of rFVIIa plus best standard therapy vs. placebo and best standard therapy alone. The investigators will include participants with a volume of ICH &amp;#8805; 2 and &lt; 60 cc, no more than a small volume of intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) (IVH score &amp;#8804; 7), age &amp;#8805; 18 and &amp;#8804; 80, Glasgow Coma Scale of &amp;#8805; 8, and treated within 120 minutes from stroke onset. To minimize time-to-treatment, the study will use emergency research informed consent procedures (including exception from informed consent (EFIC) in the United States) and mobile stroke units (MSUs), with a goal of Â½ of participants treated within 90 minutes, as accomplished in the NINDS t-PA trials. The FASTEST Trial will include approximately 100 hospital sites and at least 15 MSUs in the NINDS-funded StrokeNet and key global institutions with large volumes of ICH patients and the ability to treat them within 120 minutes of stroke onset. Recruitment of 860 participants over 3Â½ years is planned. Countries participating in the trial include the United States, Canada, Japan, Germany, Spain, and the United Kingdom.

Participants will be randomized in a double-blinded fashion to rFVIIa 80 Âµg/kg dose (maximum 10 mg dose) or placebo. Participants in both arms will receive best standard therapy as per published AHA Guidelines for ICH, including a target systolic blood pressure of 140 mm Hg. The primary outcome (ordinal mRS with the following categories: 0-2, 3, and 4-6) will be determined at 180 days, but participants will be followed by remote assessment at 30 days and 90 days. To measure growth of ICH, all participants will have a standard of care baseline non-contrast CT of the head and a repeat scan at 24 hours. Centralized volumetric measurements of ICH, IVH, and edema will be performed for both time points.

Novo Nordisk A/S will manufacture and supply rFVIIa as a research medication for use in the FASTEST Trial. Novo Nordisk A/S will also manufacture and supply matching placebo that is identical to rFVIIa in appearance and administration.</DESCRIPTION>

This trial will also address barriers to treatment of patients with PD and parkinsonism by providing rigorous evidence about whether ZA reduces fracture risk in patients with PD and parkinsonism, simplifying treatment by giving ZA at home without extra medical visits and BMD testing, and overcoming poor persistence with oral therapies because one infusion may prevent bone loss for at least 2 years. The outcome of this trial will demonstrate how a home-based fracture prevention can reach older PD patients who would not otherwise receive treatment to reduce their high risk of fractures.

Patients with PD will be recruited throughout the US by participating neurologists and health networks as well as the Parkinson's Foundation. Patients may also self-refer to the study. Interested patients can access study information on a study website (topaz.eurekaplatform.org) as well as through the Parkinson's Foundation Helpline. Patients who wish to enroll will be directed to an interactive electronic consent (eConsent). Following eConsent, participants complete a screening questionnaire (to confirm eligibility), followed by a baseline questionnaire. If a participant is determined to be eligible following these steps, they may be scheduled for a Telemedicine assessment to further confirm the PD or parkinsonism diagnosis, unless they have been referred directly from a participating neurologist. If confirmed, the participant will be mailed a supply of vitamin D3 800-1000 IU and instructed to take one vitamin D tablet every day for 2 months. Lastly, a Nurse Home Visit will be scheduled and conducted to confirm final eligibility, randomization, and administration of the study drug, if appropriate. Participants who are randomized will be contacted every 4 months for at least 2 years to determine if they have had any fractures.</DESCRIPTION>

    <DESCRIPTION>Although bariatric surgery is the most effective treatment for severe obesity, a large proportion of patients experience significant weight regain with longer follow-up.

In this randomized controlled trial employing a SMART design, a total of 120 subjects with weight regain after bariatric surgery, will be initially randomized in a 3:3:2 ratio to daily treatment with topiramate (TPM) 50 mg or phentermine (PHEN) 7.5 mg or placebo. After 4 months, responders (those with &amp;#8805;5% weight loss) will continue the same treatment, while nonresponders will be re-randomized to a higher dose of the same drug or phentermine/topiramate 7.5/50 mg combination (PHEN/TPM) during Months 5-12. All subjects will receive diet and lifestyle counseling throughout the study.

Aim 1: To determine whether pharmacotherapy can reverse post-bariatric surgery weight regain.

Hypothesis: Compared to placebo, all three active drug therapies - TPM, PHEN, and PHEN/TPM will lead to greater percent weight loss at Month 12.

Aim 2: To examine change in energy intake assessed by a dietitian interview.

Hypothesis: Compared to placebo, active drug therapies will lead to greater reduction in energy intake at Month 12.

Aim 3: To examine changes in the most common maladaptive eating behaviors in the post-bariatric surgery patients - grazing, loss-of-control eating, and binge eating.

Hypothesis: Compared to placebo, active drug therapies will lead to decreased maladaptive eating behaviors.</DESCRIPTION>

    <DESCRIPTION>The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy, safety, and feasibility of offering electroacupuncture as an intervention to improve cancer-related symptoms (cognitive impairment, fatigue, psychological distress and insomnia) and quality of life among cancer patients and survivors receiving care at UCI Health. In addition, changes in biomarkers (plasma BDNF, pro-inflammatory cytokines and mitochondrial DNA) known to be associated with cancer-related symptoms. We hypothesize that EA is an effective, safe, and feasible intervention for cancer patients and survivors.

Our specific aims are as follows:

To compare the efficacy of EA versus sham-EA control in reducing cognitive toxicity, fatigue, psychological distress, insomnia and quality of life.

To evaluate the impact of EA versus sham-EA control on biomarkers, including circulating BDNF, pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1&amp;#946;, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, TNF-alpha), mitochondrial DNA (oxidative stress indicator), and safety.

To assess the feasibility of administering EA to manage symptom clusters in cancer patients.</DESCRIPTION>

    <DETAILED_ELIGIBILITY>Study Population:
Patients with HD and their family members are recruited from specialty clinics (Human Genetics, Neurology, Psychiatry) that advise and treat people affected by HD. In addition, in some areas community clinics and neurologists who see HD patients recruit participants for this study. Participants also receive information about the study through websites, clinical practices, support groups, advocacy newsletters, etc. and place a direct request to be considered for participation in the study. Community controls are identified by study site staff (using advertisements, flyers and newsletters) with the support of the Enroll-HD operational staff.

Inclusion Criteria:
1.  Carriers: This group comprises the primary study population and consists of individuals who carry the HD gene expansion mutation.
2.  Controls: This group comprises the comparator study population and consists of individuals who do not carry the HD expansion mutation.
3.  These two major categories can be further subdivided into six different subgroups of eligible individuals:
4.  Manifest/Motor-manifest HD: Carriers with clinical features that are regarded in the opinion of the investigator as diagnostic of HD.
5.  Pre-Manifest/-Motor-manifest HD: Carriers without clinical features regarded as diagnostic of HD.
6.  Genotype Unknown: This group includes a first or second degree relative (i.e., related by blood to a carrier) who has not undergone predictive testing for HD and therefore has an undetermined carrier status.
7.  Genotype Negative: This group includes a first or second degree relative (i.e., related by blood to a carrier) who has undergone predictive testing for HD and is known not to carry the HD expansion mutation.
8.  Family Control: Family members or individuals not related by blood to carriers (e.g., spouses, partners, caregivers).
9.  Community Controls: Individuals unrelated to HD carriers who did not grow up in a family affected by HD. Data collected from community controls will be used for generation of normative data for sub-studies.
10.  Participant status will be captured in the study database using 2 variables: 1) Investigator Determined Status: this will be based on clinical signs and symptoms and genotyping performed as part of medical care, and will be updated at every visit; and 2) Research Genotyping Status: this will be based on genotyping conducted as part of Enroll-HD study procedures. Based on research genotyping, participants will be reclassified under this variable from Genotype Unknown to 'Carriers' or 'Controls'. Investigators and participants will be blinded to this reclassification.

Exclusion Criteria:
1.  Individuals who do not meet inclusion criteria,
2.  Individuals with choreic movement disorders in the context of a negative test for the HD gene mutation.
3.  For Community Controls: those individuals with a major central nervous system disorder will be excluded (e.g. stroke, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, etc.).
4.  Participants under 18 may be eligible to participate (if they have juvenile-onset HD).</DETAILED_ELIGIBILITY>
    <DESCRIPTION>The primary objective of Enroll-HD is to develop a comprehensive repository of prospective and systematically collected clinical research data (demography, clinical features, family history, genetic characteristics) and biological specimens (blood) from individuals with manifest HD, unaffected individuals known to carry the HD mutation or at risk of carrying the HD mutation, and control research participants (e.g., spouses, siblings or offspring of HD mutation carriers known not to carry the HD mutation). Enroll-HD is conceived as a broad-based and long-term project to maximize the efficiencies of non-clinical research and participation in clinical research. With 158 active clinical sites in 19 countries, Enroll-HD is now the largest HD database available and is accessible to any interested researcher - visit www.enroll-hd.org/for-researchers/access-data/ to learn more.</DESCRIPTION>

    <SUMMARY>Enroll-HD is a longitudinal, observational, multinational study that integrates two former Huntington's disease (HD) registries-REGISTRY in Europe, and COHORT in North America and Australasia-while also expanding to include sites in Latin America. More than 20,000 participants have now enrolled into the study. With annual assessments and no end date, Enroll-HD has built a large and rich database of longitudinal clinical data and biospecimens that form the basis for studies developing tools and biomarkers for progression and prognosis, identifying clinically-relevant phenotypic characteristics, and establishing clearly defined endpoints for interventional studies.

2.  These criteria are subject to change with the needs of the registry at the sole discretion of the Sponsor (Corrona).</DETAILED_ELIGIBILITY>
    <DESCRIPTION>The objective of the Corrona Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD) Registry is to create a national cohort of patients with IBD. The diseases under study include Crohn's Disease (CD) and Ulcerative Colitis (UC). Data collected will be used to better characterize the natural history of the disease and to extensively evaluate the effectiveness and safety of medications approved for the treatment of IBD. This will be done through the standardized collection of validated patient-reported outcomes (PRO) and clinician-reported outcomes (ClinRO), the prevalence and incidence of comorbidities and adverse events, medication utilization patterns, and patient productivity measures.

The design is a prospective, non-interventional registry for patients with IBD under the care of a certified gastroenterologist. Longitudinal follow-up data is collected from both patients and their treating gastroenterologist during routine clinical encounters using Corrona registry questionnaires. These questionnaires collect data on patient demographics, disease duration, medical history (including all prior and current treatments for IBD), smoking status, alcohol use, disease activity and severity, pain, as well as other clinician- and patient-reported outcomes, comorbidities and adverse events, infections, hospitalizations, and other targeted safety outcomes.

After the enrollment visit, IBD patients and physicians will complete the follow-up questionnaires during regularly scheduled clinical encounters. The goal is to collect data from patients and providers at six month intervals, not to exceed 2 visits in any 12 month period.

Adverse events may be volunteered spontaneously by the subject, or be discovered as a result of general questioning by the Investigator. During all Corrona related visits with the Investigator, subjects will be questioned regarding the occurrence of adverse events.</DESCRIPTION>

    <DESCRIPTION>SATURN is a multi-center, pragmatic, prospective, randomized, open-label, and blinded end-point assessment (PROBE) clinical trial. A total of 1,456 patients presenting within 7 days of a spontaneous lobar ICH while taking statins will be randomized to one of two treatment strategies: discontinuation vs. continuation of statin therapy (using the same agent and dose that they were using at ICH onset). Participating subjects will undergo baseline testing for APOE genotype and will be followed for 24 months to assess for the occurrence of recurrent symptomatic ICH or major adverse cerebro-/cardio-vascular events (MACCE) during the follow-up period.

Recruitment will take place at ~ 140 sites coordinated through the NIH/NINDS StrokeNet and the Canadian Stroke Consortium.</DESCRIPTION>

    <SUMMARY>The SATURN trial aims to determine whether continuation vs. discontinuation of statin drugs after spontaneous lobar intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is the best strategy; and whether the decision to continue/discontinue statins should be influenced by an individual's Apolipoprotein-E (APOE) genotype.

Participants will be randomized at 1:1 ratio to either continue the same statin drug and dosage that they are taking at the time of ICH onset or to discontinue it for up to 24 months after ICH. No placebo will be prescribed for those randomized to discontinue statins.</SUMMARY>

    <DESCRIPTION>Etavopivat is designed to activate PKR and thereby modulate RBC metabolism by impacting two critical pathways in RBCs. The etavopivat clinical development program will investigate whether decreasing 2,3-DPG may help oxygen bind to hemoglobin (i.e. increasing oxygen affinity), and thereby increase ATP and impact RBC function. This study is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter Phase 2/3 study of patients age 12 to 65 years (inclusive), with sickle cell disease. There are two planned interim analyses in this study design. Initially, patients will be randomized at 1:1:1 to one of two dose levels of etavopivat or placebo. At the first interim analysis, one of the two etavopivat dose levels will be selected for the Phase 3 portion of the study, in which patients will be randomized at 1:1 to the selected etavopivat dose or placebo. Efficacy on hemoglobin will be evaluated at the second interim analysis, and then will be tested along with evaluation of efficacy on vaso-occlusive crises at the final analysis. Following completion of 52 weeks of double-blind treatment, patients may enter a 52-week etavopivat open-label extension period.</DESCRIPTION>

2.  Inability to provide informed consent
3.  Thrombocytopenia (Platelets &lt; 50,000) or coagulopathy (INR &gt; 1.8)

    <DESCRIPTION>Pancreatic cystic lesions (PCLs) are a common incidental finding in cross sectional imaging (up to 27% on CT scan and 41% on MRI) and pose a management challenge to physicians. According to society guidelines, PCLs with specific features should prompt additional workup with endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) for cyst characterization as well as cyst sampling. This can help determine if the cyst is mucinous or non-mucinous which has implications for its malignant potential. Cyst fluid has traditionally been sampled using EUS with FNA (Fine-Needle Aspiration) and sent for fluid analysis (CEA and amylase) and cytology. However, despite use of a cyst fluid carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level cutoff of 192 ng/mL and cytology, accuracy of diagnosis for PCLs is poor. As the spectrum ranges from benign to high risk for neoplasm, precise diagnosis is critical. More recently, the adjunctive use of the MorayÂ® through the needle microforceps biopsy (EUS-MFB) has shown promise for diagnosis of PCLs. This technology utilizes a microforceps through a 19-guage needle to biopsy the cyst wall for histology, in addition to collecting cyst fluid for CEA level and cytology. Only a few small retrospective reports have been published regarding the use of MFB. Pancreatic cysts continue to pose a management dilemma for practicing clinicians, especially with the increased use of radiologic imaging modalities identifying incidental pancreatic cystic lesions with higher frequency. This leads to patient anxiety and increased costs due to radiologic surveillance and even surgery. The results of this study will hopefully help increase diagnostic yield by obtaining a histopathologic diagnosis of these PCLs, and potentially affect practice patterns of gastroenterologists and the endoscopic community, specifically those physicians who perform EUS in these patients. Furthermore, the results will help determine whether there is reason to continue this line of research to obtain a definite histologic tissue diagnosis of PCLs.</DESCRIPTION>

    <DESCRIPTION>This platform trial will provide access to repurposed and investigational agents for critically ill patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 who have severe or life-threatening COVID-19. Any critically ill patient with known or presumed COVID-19 will be automatically entered into the screening phase of the trial until SARS-CoV-2 infection is confirmed. Basic data will be assembled for each patient (such as ventilatory status and survival). All patients who start high-flow oxygen (WHO COVID-19 level 5; &gt; 6L oxygen by nasal prongs or mask) will be entered in an observational registry which will only require extraction of medical record data. Registry participants will be asked to sign a consent form for the backbone treatment and a specific investigational agent arm to which they are assigned. The primary endpoint will be time to recover to a durable level 4 (or less) on the WHO COVID-19 ordinal scale for clinical improvement. For this trial, a durable level 4 is defined as at least 48 hours at COVID level 4 or less (nasal prongs oxygen) without returning to high flow oxygen or intubation. Acute care facility resource utilization will be automatically calculated (total length of stay in a critical care setting, days intubated, and survival). Any change in status, including intubation, extubation, death or discharge, will be recorded and verified by the attending physician.

Patients will be evaluated based on their initial status (ventilation at entry vs. high flow oxygen). Exploratory biomarkers will be evaluated over time (ARDS phenotypes and other proposed markers) to facilitate clinical learning. The trial will begin enrollment with two investigational agents and quickly increase to four study arms as the pace of enrollment increases. The anticipated accrual will be 50 patients per week. The maximum number of participants assigned to an arm without graduation will be 125 patients. Agents can be dropped for futility after enrollment of 50 patients. It is anticipated that 10 investigational agents can be evaluated in the span of 4-6 months, depending on the time course of COVID-19 infections across the US. As the trial proceeds and a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of the COVID-19 illness emerges, expanded biomarker and data collection can be added as needed to further elucidate how agents are or are not working. The study design features comparison of investigational agent efficacy using a Bayesian design, which will allow the detection of strong efficacy signals with the fewest possible patients. Initially the control will be patients given current standard of care (supportive care for ARDS, including lung protective ventilation and remdesivir as backbone therapy). As other treatments (for example, anticoagulation) become part of standard supportive care across sites, these will be added to the backbone therapy. If an agent meets the threshold for graduation the company leadership will be informed as will the FDA. The arm with the graduated agent will cease to enroll, allowing a new arm with a different investigational agent to be added. Information about agents disposition will be as follows:

Every trial participant will have blood collected at trial enrollment, day 3, and day 7 for pre-specified biomarker and DNA and RNA analysis. Additional biomarkers can be added as the trial proceeds. Patient outcomes will also be evaluated on the basis of whether patients are ventilated initially or not.</DESCRIPTION>

    <SUMMARY>The goal of this project is to rapidly screen promising agents, in the setting of an adaptive platform trial, for treatment of critically ill COVID-19 patients. In this phase 2 platform design, agents will be identified with a signal suggesting a big impact on reducing mortality and the need for, as well as duration, of mechanical ventilation.</SUMMARY>

    <DESCRIPTION>The objective of the registry is to create a cohort of patients with NMOSD. Data collected will be used to prospectively study the natural history of NMOSD, real-word effectiveness and safety of medications used to treat NMOSD, and drug utilization treatment patterns. Additionally, the data will be used to systematically evaluate the burden for patients with NMOSD and the impact of therapies on quality of life. This will be done through real time capture and adjudication of relapses, the standardized collection of patient-reported outcomes (PRO) and clinician-reported outcomes (ClinRO), the active evaluation of prevalent and incident comorbidities and adverse events, and the recording of medication utilization patterns.

Personal information is also collected from each consenting registry patient allowing for linkages to other public or private clinical and administrative databases, as well as to databases maintained by organizations focused on the care and treatment of NMOSD for the purposes of clinical, market, or outcomes research. This provides an opportunity to evaluate other aspects of the disease and its treatment including but not limited to clinical and drug cost-effectiveness, health care resource utilization, and patient adherence.

Consent for additional ad hoc surveys will be solicited which can allow evaluation of additional aspects of the disease impact such as care giver burden or impact of disease on productivity.</DESCRIPTION>

1.  Age 3 to &lt;13 years at the time of randomization
2.  Amblyopia associated with anisometropia, strabismus, or both
3.  No previous treatment for amblyopia, including no more than 24 hours of spectacle wear.
4.  Investigator planning to initiate spectacle correction of refractive error meeting the following criteria based on a cycloplegic refraction that has been performed within 30 days:
5.  At enrollment, single VA measured in each eye assessed in trial frames with the spectacle correction the investigator plans to prescribe, using the investigator's routine method
6.  Investigator is willing to prescribe spectacle wear followed sequentially by patching or simultaneous spectacles and patching treatment per protocol.
7.  Parent understands the protocol and is willing to accept randomization.
8.  Parent has phone (or access to phone) and is willing to be contacted by Jaeb Center staff or other study staff.

Exclusion Criteria:
1.  Myopia greater than -6.00 D spherical equivalent in either eye.
2.  Previous intraocular or refractive surgery.
3.  Planned strabismus surgery in the next 56 weeks.
4.  Any previous treatment for amblyopia (patching, atropine, Bangerter filter, vision therapy, or binocular treatment).
5.  Previous spectacle or contact lens wear for more than 24 hours.
6.  Parent and participant willing to forego option of contact lens wear for the duration of the study.
7.  Ocular co-morbidity that may reduce VA determined by an ocular examination performed within the past 7 months (Note: nystagmus per se does not exclude the participant if the above VA criteria are met).
8.  Severe developmental delay that would interfere with treatment or evaluation (in the opinion of the investigator). Participants with mild speech delay or reading and/or learning disabilities or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are not excluded.
9.  Known allergy to adhesive patches.
10.  Known allergy to silicone.</DETAILED_ELIGIBILITY>
    <DESCRIPTION>At an enrollment visit, distance VA will be measured in trial frames with or without cycloplegia based on a cycloplegic refraction performed within 30 days. If still apparently eligible, children will be prescribed spectacles and will then return for a spectacle baseline visit, where they will wear their new spectacles for the first time for at least 10 minutes (but no more than 24 hours) and will be tested in those new spectacles to confirm final eligibility prior to randomization.

Participants not found to be eligible in their new spectacles will end study participation. Participants eligible for the study will be randomly allocated to one of two treatment groups: Sequential (spectacles alone) and then patching if needed (monitored by ODM), or Simultaneous (spectacles and patching monitored by ODM).

After randomization, follow-up visits will occur at 8-week intervals through 56 weeks. At each visit on or after the 8-week visit, participants will be classified as either: stable/worsening or improving; those stable/worsening are then classified as having either resolved or residual amblyopia, provided that the current and most recent previous visit were completed at least 6-weeks apart (target 8 weeks) and provided the required test and retest VA testing was completed. Participants who are stable/worsening and have residual amblyopia in the sequential group will start patching (monitored by ODM) and continue to be followed every 8 weeks. Participants in the simultaneous group, or in the sequential group after having advanced to patching, who are stable/worsening but have residual amblyopia will be released to treatment at investigator discretion.

All participants continue 8-weekly visits until 56 weeks when Study participation ends.</DESCRIPTION>

If both eyes are eligible, then both are included. If one eye is eligible and the other eye has type 1 ROP with ROP or vessels in zone 2, then both eyes will receive the treatment randomly assigned. If one eye is eligible and the fellow eye later develops type 1 ROP within 4 weeks of injection in the first eye, then the fellow eye will also receive the treatment randomly assigned to the first eye and the fellow eye will follow the same 4-week post-injection study exam schedule, unless the first eye has already met failure criteria, in which case treatment and follow-up for the fellow eye is at investigator discretion.

Exclusion Criteria:

Participants meeting any of the following exclusion criteria will be excluded from study participation.

1.  Previous treatment for ROP
2.  Stage 4 or 5 ROP in either eye
3.  Treatment could not be done within 2 days of diagnosis of type 1 ROP
4.  Investigator unwilling to randomize or parent unwilling to accept randomized assignment to either treatment
5.  Transfer to another hospital anticipated within the next 4 weeks where exams by study-certified examiners are not available. If hospital discharge is anticipated within the next 4 weeks, parents unable or unwilling to return to the PEDIG site for outpatient follow-up visits.
6.  Active ocular infection or purulent nasolacrimal duct obstruction in either eye

One eye will be excluded, and other eye may be eligible, if either of the following are present:
1.  Visually significant ocular anomaly (e.g., cataract, coloboma)
2.  Opacity that precludes an adequate view of the retina</DETAILED_ELIGIBILITY>
    <DESCRIPTION>Infants with type 1 ROP and no prior treatment for ROP will be randomly assigned (1:1) to treatment with either intravitreous bevacizumab 0.063 mg or either intravitreous bevacizumab 0.25 mg. Study exams will be at 1 day, 4 days (if no improvement on day 1), 1, 2, 3, and 4 weeks, and at 2 and 4-months post-treatment (and re-treatment when indicated). Additional study exams will occur at adjusted age 6 and 12 months. Non-study examinations will be at clinician discretion and are likely to occur more often. The primary outcome will be treatment success within each dose group, defined as improvement by the day 4 exam and no recurrence of type 1 ROP or severe neovascularization requiring additional treatment within 4 weeks of injection. Important secondary outcomes include safety and efficacy. refractive outcomes, and the extent of retinal vascularization at 2 and 4 months post-injection between the two dose groups.</DESCRIPTION>

</DETAILED_ELIGIBILITY>
    <DESCRIPTION>N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis is one of the most common causes of autoimmune encephalitis, with prevalence exceeding herpes encephalitis in industrialized nations. Typically, the disease affects patients age 10-50 causing prominent psychiatric symptoms, altered consciousness, seizures, movement disorders and life-threatening dysautonomia. Intensive care, including cardiorespiratory support is required in 75% of cases. The diagnosis is confirmed by detection of IgG autoantibodies against central nervous system NMDAR in the cerebrospinal fluid. Despite the severity of the illness, NMDAR encephalitis is a treatable neurological disease, with retrospective case series establishing the benefit of off-label intravenous steroids and immunoglobulins. These treatments are presumed to work through effects on IgG NMDAR autoantibody levels in the CSF, although prospective data informing predictors of treatment responses are limited. Even with prompt treatment, ~50% of patients remain disabled, requiring prolonged hospital admissions. Various off-label therapies have been proposed as "second-line" treatments in NMDAR encephalitis. The majority of second-line treatments target circulating B-cells with various degrees of blood brain penetrance and efficacy, and poor consensus on the timing, dose and route of delivery of candidate agents. High-quality evidence is needed to inform the treatment of NMDAR encephalitis. Inebilizumab is a promising therapeutic monoclonal antibody for the treatment of NMDAR encephalitis. This humanized monoclonal antibody against the B-cell surface antigen CD19 was recently shown to be safe and efficacious in the treatment of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder-another antibody-mediated disorder of the central nervous system. Compared to other off label B-cell depleting therapies, such as rituximab, inebilizumab not only depletes CD20+ B-cells, but also CD20- plasmablasts and plasma cells, resulting in robust and sustained suppression of B-cell expression. The ExTINGUISH Trial will randomize 116 participants with moderate-to-severe NMDAR encephalitis to receive either inebilizumab or placebo in addition to first-line therapies. Patient outcomes will be ascertained at standard intervals using the modified Rankin scale and accepted safety measures (primary outcomes at 16 weeks), together with comprehensive validated neuropsychological tests, bedside cognitive screening tools, quality of life/ functional indices, and outcome prediction measures. Clinical data will be combined with quantitative measures of NMDAR autoantibody titers and cytokines implicated in B-cell activation and antibody production within the intrathecal compartment to identify treatment responders, inform the biologic contributors to outcomes, and evaluate for biomarkers that may serve as early predictors of favorable outcomes in future clinical trials in NMDAR encephalitis. The ExTINGUISH Trial will prospectively study an optimized B-cell depletion therapy to promote better long-term outcomes in NMDAR encephalitis, to determine more meaningful cognitive endpoints, and to identify better biologic biomarkers to predict outcome.</DESCRIPTION>

    <DESCRIPTION>AV-001 is a synthetic Angiopoietin-1 (Angpt-1) mimetic that has been shown to activate the Tie2 receptor tyrosine kinase; a transmembrane protein target most highly expressed on the surface of endothelial cells in the vasculature. The Tie2/Angiopoietin signaling axis has been identified as a nonredundant gatekeeper of vascular homeostasis. In healthy individuals, Tie2 is highly activated and signals the endothelium to fortify intracellular junctions and reduce expression of adhesion molecules, which serve as leukocyte tethers upon inflammation. As such, homeostatic activation results in the promotion of barrier defense against vascular leakage.

The study population for this Phase 2a study will consist of male and non-pregnant female patients, greater than or equal to 18 years of age, hospitalized with presumed pneumonia secondary to SARS-CoV-2 or other viral or bacterial infection with acute onset to a respiratory compromise requiring supplemental oxygen therapy.</DESCRIPTION>

2.  Acute non-cardioembolic stroke or high-risk TIA
3.  Systemic or cerebrovascular atherosclerosis or acute non-lacunar infarct

Exclusion Criteria:
1.  Ischemic stroke less than or equal to 7 days before the index stroke event
2.  Index stroke following procedures or strokes due to other rare causes
3.  History of atrial fibrillation/flutter, left ventricular thrombus, mechanic valve or other cardioembolic source of stroke requiring anticoagulation</DETAILED_ELIGIBILITY>
    <DESCRIPTION>Researchers are looking for a better way to prevent an ischemic stroke which occurs when a blood clot travelled to the brain in people who within the last 72 hours had:

an acute stroke due to a blood clot that formed outside the heart (acute non-cardioembolic ischemic stroke), or
TIA/mini-stroke with a high risk of turning into a stroke (high-risk transient ischemic attack), and who are planned to receive standard of care therapy. Acute ischemic strokes or TIA/mini-stroke result from a blocked or reduced blood flow to a part of the brain. They are caused by blood clots that travel to the brain and block the vessels that supply it. If these blood clots form elsewhere than in the heart, the stroke is called non-cardioembolic. People who already had a non-cardioembolic stroke are more likely to have another stroke. This is why they are treated preventively with an antiplatelet therapy, the current standard of care. Antiplatelet medicines prevent platelets, components of blood clotting, from clumping together.
Anticoagulants are another type of medicine that prevents blood clots from forming by interfering with a process known as coagulation (or blood clotting).

The study treatment asundexian is a new type of anticoagulant currently under development to provide further treatment options. Asundexian aims to further improve the standard of care without increasing the risk of bleeding.

The main purpose of this study is to learn whether asundexian works better than placebo at reducing ischemic strokes in participants who recently had a non-cardioembolic ischemic stroke or TIA/mini-stroke when given in addition to standard antiplatelet therapy. A placebo is a treatment that looks like a medicine but does not have any medicine in it.

Another aim is to compare the occurrence of major bleeding events during the study between the asundexian and the placebo group. Major bleedings have a serious or even life-threatening impact on a person's health.

Dependent on the treatment group, the participants will either take asundexian or placebo as tablets once a day for at least 3 months up to 31 months.

Approximately every 3 months during the treatment period, either a phone call or a visit to the study site is scheduled on an alternating basis. In addition, one visit before and up to two visits after the treatment period are planned.

During the study, the study team will:

1.  Check vital signs such as blood pressure and heart rate
2.  Examine the participants' heart health using an electrocardiogram (ECG)
3.  Take blood samples
4.  Ask the participants questions about how they are feeling and what adverse events they are having.

An adverse event is any medical problem that a participant has during a study. Doctors keep track of all adverse events that happen in studies, even if they do not think the adverse events might be related to the study treatments. In addition, the participants will be asked to complete a questionnaire on quality of life at certain time points during the study.</DESCRIPTION>

The investigators propose three specific aims by conducting a randomized, triple-blind clinical trial that enrolls 900 patients 60 years of age or older undergoing cardiac surgery. Through this trial, the investigators will determine the effect of IV acetaminophen on;

1.  the incidence, duration, and severity of postoperative delirium,
2.  the use of opioids and other rescue analgesics in the first 48 postoperative hours, daily pain scores at rest and exertion, and length of stay in the Intensive Care Unit and overall hospital length of stay
3.  longer-term (one, six, 12 months) cognitive, physical, and self-care functional recovery after surgery.</DESCRIPTION>

    <DESCRIPTION>Understanding the effectiveness of intensive patching has important implications for managing children with IXT. If full-time patching is associated with improvement in distance control vs an observation group, then future studies can be conducted to evaluate different durations of full-time patching treatment, whether the effect is maintained off-treatment, and how full-time patching compares to other treatment strategies.

The purpose of this study is to determine whether full-time patching is more effective than observation for improving distance control of IXT after 3 months of treatment (on-treatment outcome).</DESCRIPTION>

    <DESCRIPTION>Becker Muscular Dystrophy (BMD) is most frequently due to in-frame mutations in the dystrophin gene that are associated with reduced levels of frequently shortened dystrophin, though other mutations may be related to the Becker phenotype. There is wide variation in the age of onset and degree of progression, ranging from childhood to late adulthood. The more severe form of dystrophinopathy, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, has a more characteristic rate of progression and overall natural history. The wide variation in severity of progression has led to challenges in the design and conduct of approaching therapeutic trials. There is a need for a more rigorous natural history study to assist in the design of these promising therapeutic trials.</DESCRIPTION>

    <DESCRIPTION>A study of sevasemten (EDG-5506) in Becker muscular dystrophy (known as CANYON) and pivotal cohort (known as GRAND CANYON). The EDG-5506-201 CANYON study was expanded to include an additional 120 adult participants in a cohort called GRAND CANYON, that is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of sevasemten in adults with Becker.

CANYON is fully enrolled; GRAND CANYON is currently enrolling.


The EDG-5506-201 protocol was amended to include an additional cohort thus consists of two parts.

Part 1: CANYON is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled design to investigate the effect of sevasemten on the safety, pharmacokinetics, biomarkers, and functional measures. Approximately 32 adults and 18 adolescents with Becker muscular dystrophy are planned to enroll in this study. This study will have up to a 4-week Screening period, a 12-month Treatment period, followed by a 4-week follow-up period.

Approximately 32 adult participants will randomize to Cohort 1 or Cohort 2 in a 1:1 ratio then each cohort will further randomize to sevasemten or placebo in a 3:1 ratio.

Approximately 9 adolescent participants will enroll in Cohort 4 and randomize in a 2:1 ratio to sevasemten or placebo. Cohort 5 will randomize an additional 9 participants in a 2:1 ratio to either sevasemten or placebo after Cohort 4.

CANYON is now fully enrolled.

Part 2: GRAND CANYON or Cohort 6 is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled design to investigate the safety and efficacy of sevasemten in adults with Becker muscular dystrophy after 18 months of treatment. Approximately 120 adults with Becker muscular dystrophy are planned to enroll in this study. This study will have up to a 4-week Screening period, an 18-month Treatment period, followed by a 4-week follow-up period.

Approximately 120 adult participants will be randomized in Cohort 6 in a 2:1 ratio either to sevasemten or placebo.</DESCRIPTION>

      <OBJECTIVES>A study of EDG-5506 in Becker muscular dystrophy (known as CANYON) and pivotal cohort (known as GRAND CANYON). The EDG-5506-201 CANYON study was expanded to include an additional 120 adult participants in a cohort called GRAND CANYON. GRAND CANYON is designed similar to a Phase 3 study and seeks to demonstrate whether the safety and efficacy of EDG-5506 are sufficient to support a marketing application. It is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of EDG-5506 in adults with Becker muscular dystrophy.

CANYON is fully enrolled; GRAND CANYON is currently enrolling.</OBJECTIVES>

- Multifocal CIDP: documented sensory loss and muscle weakness in a multifocal pattern, usually asymmetric, upper limb predominant
- Focal CIDP: sensory loss and muscle weakness in only one limb
- Motor CIDP: motor symptoms and signs without sensory involvement

Cohorts A and B:
3.  Have electrodiagnostic test results supporting the diagnosis of CIDP in accordance with the EAN/PNS Guideline on Diagnosis and Treatment of CIDP; for Cohorts A and B, either criterion must be met:

a)  Motor nerve conduction criteria strongly supportive of demyelination.
b) Motor nerve conduction criteria weakly supportive of demyelination and 2 or more of the following additional diagnostic criteria:
- Objective improvement to an empiric trial of therapy with immunoglobulin treatment, plasma exchange (PLEX), or corticosteroids.
- Diagnostic imaging by ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) supporting the diagnosis of CIDP by demonstrating nerve enlargement.

    <DESCRIPTION>The purpose of the study is to understand how the study medicine PF-06823859 works in people with idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (DM and PM). These disorders cause inflammation that weakens the muscles that are important for movement and may also cause skin rash in people with DM.

This study is seeking participants who:

 -  Are 18 years of age or older.
 -  Have active DM or active PM.
 -  Are receiving a stable dose of 1 corticosteroid taken by mouth and/or 1 traditional immunosuppressant.

Note: Corticosteroids and immunosuppressants are medicines that help reduce inflammation and may signal to the immune system not to attack the body.

Dermatomyositis (DM) is a rare disease that causes muscle inflammation that results in muscle weakness and low muscle stamina. Patients with DM have a characteristic skin rash. Polymyositis (PM) is a rare disease that involves mainly muscle inflammation resulting in muscle weakness, that can sometimes be painful. Patients with DM and PM may have trouble going up the steps, walking or getting to a standing position.

Some of the participants will receive the study medicine (PF-06823859) and some will receive placebo (which is similar to study medicine but contains no medicine in it).

The study medicine or placebo will be given as an intravenous (IV) infusion (directly into the veins), which takes about1 hour; every 4 weeks from Day 1 to Week 48 of the study. Both PF-06823859 and placebo and will be given at the study site.

The study will compare the experiences of people receiving study medication to those of the people who do not. This will help to see if PF-06823859 is safe and effective.

Participants will take part in this study for about 13 months. During this time, participants will have 16 study visits. These visits will be performed at the study site.</DESCRIPTION>

    <DESCRIPTION>This is a post-market, prospective, interventional, global, multi-center, randomized, dual-arm clinical trial. The primary objective of this trial is to evaluate sac regression outcomes of the Medtronic Endurant II/IIs Stent Graft System and Gore Excluder/Excluder Conformable AAA Endoprosthesis in standard EVAR subjects. Subjects are randomized on a 1:1 basis to receive EVAR with either a Medtronic Endurant II/IIs Stent Graft Systems or Gore Excluder / Excluder Conformable AAA Endoprosthesis. Data is collected pre- and post-procedure at discharge, at 30 days, and once a year until the 5-year follow-up is completed. An estimate of 550 subjects (minimum 500) are enrolled at up to 100 sites globally, with the potential to extend enrollment up to 900 subjects based on predictive probability analysis to adequately achieve either non-inferiority or superiority for the primary endpoint.</DESCRIPTION>

    <DESCRIPTION>Muscle-specific tyrosine kinase (MuSK) myasthenia gravis (MG) is a rare but potentially severe disease, in which patients develop pathogenic autoantibodies that specifically target the MuSK protein in the neuromuscular junction. This phase 1 study is being conducted to evaluate the safety of various dosing regimens of an investigational cell therapy, MuSK-CAART, that can be given to patients with anti-MuSK antibody positive Myasthenia Gravis (MuSK MG), who have active disease. Various dosing regimens of MuSK-CAART alone, in combination with cyclophosphamide (CY), and in combination with CY and fludarabine (FLU) will be evaluated. Treatment with MuSK-CAART may potentially lead to complete and durable remission of disease.</DESCRIPTION>

    <DESCRIPTION>Testicular cancer diagnosis and treatment, especially given its threat to sexuality and reproductive health, can be distressing in the formative period of young adulthood. Cohort studies reveal the prevalence of depressive symptoms in testicular cancer exceeds the general population. In fact, the majority of young adult cancer survivors will experience impairing, distressing, and modifiable physical, behavioral, and psychosocial adverse outcomes that persist long after the completion of primary medical treatment. These include psychological distress, impairment in the navigation and pursuit of life goals, persistent side effects, elevated risk of secondary malignancies and chronic illness, and biobehavioral burden (e.g., enhanced inflammation, dysregulated stress hormones) which influence morbidity and disease-related vulnerabilities. However, few targeted, effective interventions exist to assist young survivors in re-negotiating life goals and regulating cancer-related emotions and none focus on reducing the burden of morbidity via biobehavioral mechanisms.

Young or "emerging" adulthood is a period marked by goal attainment. Chronic illness experienced as "off time" in the lifespan interrupts goal pursuits and threatens valued life directions. As young adults return to goal pursuits, re-entry to post-cancer life can be a critical point in the survivorship trajectory. Behavioral intervention at this time is well positioned to confer longer-term impact. Emergent from our group's preliminary research, we developed and pilot-tested Goal-focused Emotion-Regulation Therapy (GET) as a novel behavioral intervention to enhance self-regulation through improved goal navigation skills, improved sense of purpose, and better ability to regulate emotional responses in young adults with testicular cancer. GET is a promising candidate intervention to address the mechanisms likely complicating the resolution of cancer-related burden.

Responsive the need for feasible, effective, and scalable interventions, we will randomly allocate 250 young adult (ages 18 -39) testicular cancer patients to 6 sessions of GET or ISL, and evaluate primary and secondary outcomes at baseline, post-treatment, 3-month follow-up, and 6-months follow-up. We predict that GET will be associated with superior distress outcomes and comparatively greater reductions in adverse biobehavioral indicators (dysregulated diurnal stress hormones, elevated systemic inflammation), and these advantages will be maintained at three- and six-months following intervention. The intervention will be delivered via an interactive video platform to enhance access. An additional exploratory aim focuses on potential epigenetic vulnerabilities, to understand how environmental influences (via DNA methylation) on genes implicated in stress reactivity and mood regulation are related to cancer adjustment and intervention response.

This study capitalizes on the study team's unique expertise in biobehavioral oncology and salivary bioscience to test a novel behavioral intervention for young adult survivors. It has potential to understand how to alter proximal behavioral, biological, and psychological factors that underscore long term adverse effects.</DESCRIPTION>

    <DESCRIPTION>DF9001-001 is a study of a new molecule that targets natural killer (NK) cells and T-cell activation signals to specific receptors on cancer cells. The study will occur in two phases. The first phase will be a dose escalation phase, enrolling patients with various types of solid tumors that express epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). A combination therapy cohort will be opened for enrollment, DF9001 + nivolumab. The second phase will include a dose expansion using the best dose selected from the first phase of the study. Multiple cohorts will be opened with eligible patients having selected solid tumors.</DESCRIPTION>

    <DESCRIPTION>Multiple myeloma is an incurable, malignant, plasma cell disorder. Teclistamab (JNJ-64007957) is a full-size, Immunoglobulin G (IgG) 4 proline, alanine, and alanine (PAA) bispecific antibody that targets the cluster of differentiation (CD3) receptor expressed on the surface of T cells and B cell maturation antigen (BCMA). With its dual binding sites, teclistamab is able to draw CD3 positive T cells in close proximity to BCMA positive cells, resulting in T-cell activation and subsequent lysis of BCMA positive cells. Pomalidomide is a third-generation immunomodulatory imide drug (IMiD) that exerts potent, direct tumoricidal and immune-enhancing effects and Carfilzomib is a second-generation proteasome inhibitor that inhibits proteasome which results in disruption of protein turnover and induces apoptosis. The primary hypothesis of this study is that teclistamab monotherapy (Arm A) will significantly improve progression free survival (PFS) compared with investigator's choice of PVd or Kd (Arm B) in participants with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who have received 1 to 3 prior lines of therapy, including an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody and lenalidomide. The study will include a screening phase, treatment phase, and follow-up phase. Safety will be assessed by physical examinations, neurologic examinations, eastern cooperative oncology group (ECOG) performance status, clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, and AE monitoring. The overall duration of the study will be up to 9 years.</DESCRIPTION>

    <DETAILED_ELIGIBILITY>To be in this study, if you have any tumor type except colorectal cancer you must have a tumor that is positive for expression of the target, B7-H6 via central laboratory testing. If you have colorectal cancer, your tumor will still be tested for B7-H6 by the central laboratory however, you do not need to know the status prior to enrolling. You must have measurable tumors and a tumor that can be biopsied (tumor tissue sample obtained) before study treatment starts and (if you are assigned to certain treatment slots) during study treatment.

You cannot be in this study if you have had major surgery within 28 days. You cannot be in this study if you have or have had a history of an autoimmune disease, are infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), have active hepatitis B or C, or if you chronically abuse alcohol or drugs.

If you received an anti-cancer treatment or investigational study drug recently, you may need to wait up to 21 days (from the last dose of that treatment) before you can receive a first dose of study drug in this study.</DETAILED_ELIGIBILITY>
    <DESCRIPTION>This study is open to adults with advanced solid tumors whose previous cancer treatment was not successful. People can participate if their tumor has the B7-H6 marker or if they have colorectal cancer.

The study tests 2 medicines called BI 765049 and ezabenlimab (BI 754091). Both medicines may help the immune system fight cancer.

The purpose of this study is to find out the highest dose of BI 765049 alone and in combination with ezabenlimab the participants can tolerate. In this study, BI 765049 is given to people for the first time.

Participants can stay in the study for up to 3 years, if they benefit from treatment and can tolerate it. During this time, they get BI 765049 alone or in combination with ezabenlimab as infusion into a vein every 3 weeks.

The doctors check the health of the participants and note any health problems that could have been caused by BI 765049 or ezabenlimab. The doctors also regularly monitor the size of the tumor.</DESCRIPTION>

    <DESCRIPTION>The incidence and prevalence of kidney stone disease has continually increased in both developed and underdeveloped countries. With the surge in cases, the cost of treatment has also increased substantially. In 2014, it has been reported that treatment of kidney stones cost a total of 2.81 billion USD, and this is projected to increase by 1.24 billion USD per year. Although there has been great technological advancement in surgical treatment of kidney stones, such as minimally invasive surgery, the rate of recurrence is unfortunately high among stone formers, upwards of 50 percent at 5-10 years. Recurring stone disease results in more frequent surgical interventions and further expense. Thus, there is an increasing need for primary stone prevention.

Kidney stones have varying compositions with the most common being calcium oxalate. Uric acid stones are the third most common type of stone and account for 10 percent of all stone formers. One of the common abnormalities for patients with calcium oxalate stones, is low citrate levels in the urine. Citrate is the primary inhibitor of calcium oxalate crystal formation, growth, and aggregation. As such, regimens to increase urinary citrate have been undertaken. The most common drug used in this regard is potassium citrate (i.e., Urocit K). While effective, the drug remains costly with prescription costs ranging as high as $450/month. With regard to uric acid stone formation, a prerequisite is an acidic urine given that the pKa for uric acid is a pH of 5.5; once the pH is above 6.0, uric acid stones do not form. Indeed, the uric acid stone is the only one that can be dissolved if one is able to raise the pH to 6.5 -7.0.

Current medical therapy for hypocitraturia in patients with calcium oxalate stones, is the use of a slow-release tablet of potassium citrate (e.g., UrocitK). Current medical therapy for uric acid stone formers is likewise potassium citrate as it will raise the urine pH. A prescription of potassium citrate with the typical dosage of 30 meq twice a day can cost the patient upwards of $450/month. Additionally, potassium citrate tablets are associated with adverse effects such as nausea and diarrhea with additional concerns with respect to the potassium load among patients with poor renal function. Furthermore, the wax matrix tablets are large in size and difficult to swallow.

Pinheiro et al. in a prior study demonstrated that sodium bicarbonate in tablet form at a dose of 60 milliequivalent (mEq) per day was comparable to Urocit-K in increasing urinary pH and urinary citrate levels in calcium stone forming hypocitriuric patients. The study was limited by a small sample size (n=16) and short duration of therapy (3 days). Despite these favorable results, over the ensuing decade, there has been minimal interest in the use of sodium bicarbonate as a preventative treatment in stone formers who are hypocitriuric or uric acid stone formers.

Baking soda is a common household item and is openly available throughout the world in most grocery stores. The main component of baking soda is sodium bicarbonate. Various studies have shown that a teaspoon of baking soda (4.8g) has an equivalent of 59 mEq of sodium bicarbonate. A pound of baking soda, or 96 teaspoons, costs $1 which reduces the cost of a daily dosage of 60 mEq to less than a penny. The cost of 60 mEq (seven 650 mg Pills) of Sodium Bicarbonate in pill form is 15 cents.

Investigators hypothesize that the use of baking soda in stone formers with calcium oxalate associated hypocitraturia or with uric acid stones will increase urinary citrate and increase urine pH to the benefit of both patient groups. If proven effective, this approach could markedly lower the risk of stone formation in calcium oxalate and uric acid stone formers, while providing an inexpensive solution on a global level to an otherwise very expensive and debilitating ailment.</DESCRIPTION>

    <DESCRIPTION>This phase III trial compares total ablative therapy and usual systemic therapy to usual systemic therapy alone in treating patients with colorectal cancer that has spread to up to 4 body sites (limited metastatic). The usual approach for patients who are not participating in a study is treatment with intravenous (IV) (through a vein) and/or oral medications (systemic therapy) to help stop the cancer sites from getting larger and the spread of the cancer to additional body sites. Ablative means that the intention of the local treatment is to eliminate the cancer at that metastatic site. The ablative local therapy will consist of very focused, intensive radiotherapy called stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) with or without surgical resection and/or microwave ablation, which is a procedure where a needle is temporarily inserted in the tumor and heat is used to destroy the cancer cells. SABR, surgical resection, and microwave ablation have been tested for safety, but it is not scientifically proven that the addition of these treatments are beneficial for your stage of cancer. The addition of ablative local therapy to all known metastatic sites to the usual approach of systemic therapy could shrink or remove the tumor(s) or prevent the tumor(s) from returning.</DESCRIPTION>

    <DESCRIPTION>This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center
Phase 2a dose-ranging study to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and
tolerability of HT-001 for the treatment of EGFRI-induced skin
toxicity. The study will include adult patients (18 years of age)
receiving initial or repeat EGFRI therapy.
The study will be conducted in parallel in 2 cohorts: Part 1 (only at
selected PK sites), an open-label cohort consisting of 12 patients to
measure PK of HT-001 (2% aprepitant); and Part 2 (all sites), a
randomized, parallel arm study comparing 3 dose strengths of
HT-001 (0.5%, 1%, or 2% aprepitant) to placebo (HT-001 vehicle).
Patients in the randomized cohorts will be randomly assigned to 1 of
the 4 treatment arms in a 2:2:2:1 ratio 
All patients in both open-label and blinded cohorts will apply the
study drug once a day to each area affected with cutaneous toxicity
up to 30% body surface area (BSA) involvement, inclusive of skin,
scalp, and nails.
Patients initiating EGFRI therapy will be monitored by their
oncologist for development of cutaneous toxicities and will be
referred for Screening/Baseline (V1), at which point they will be
enrolled in either the open-label cohort (Part 1) for application of
HT-001 (2% aprepitant) for 6 weeks or randomized to HT-001
(0.5%, 1.0%, or 2.0% aprepitant) or placebo (HT-001 vehicle) for
6 weeks (Part 2). Patients in the randomized, double-blind cohort
(Part 2 only) will be stratified across severity scores of acneiform
rash to allow for subgroup analysis for safety and efficacy per
severity. All affected BSA with EGFRI-related cutaneous toxicity

    <DESCRIPTION>The goal of the study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and efficacy of TERN-701, a novel highly selective allosteric inhibitor of BCR-ABL1, in participants with previously treated chronic phase - chronic myeloid leukemia (CP-CML).

The study has two parts: Part 1 of the trial (Dose Escalation) will evaluate sequential dose escalation cohorts of TERN-701 administered once daily.

Part 2 (Dose Expansion) consists of randomized, parallel dose expansion cohorts of TERN-701 that will further evaluate the efficacy and safety of at least 2 recommended dose levels for expansion selected from Part 1.

In both Part 1 and Part 2, participants will receive continuous daily dosing of TERN-701 divided into 28-day cycles. During the treatment period, participants will have scheduled visits to the trial center at Cycle 1 day 1(C1D1), C1D2, C1D8, C1D15, and C1D16, followed by Day 1 of Cycles 2 through 7, and Day 1 of every 3 cycles thereafter.

Approximately 60 to 80 participants could be enrolled in this trial, including approximately 24 to 36 participants in Part 1 (dose escalation), including optional backfill cohorts, and approximately 40 participants in Part 2 (randomized dose expansion).

All participants will receive active trial intervention.

Up to 4 dose-level cohorts may be evaluated in Part 1; at least 2 dose levels may be evaluated in Part 2.</DESCRIPTION>

    <DESCRIPTION>This study consists of a Dose Escalation part with 3+3 Dose Escalation and Safety/PK/PD subparts, and a Phase 1b Efficacy Expansion part that will explore the clinical activity and expand the understanding of its safety profile in patients with advanced (unresectable, recurrent, or metastatic) melanoma patients who have received immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy and progressed.
The United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) has recently recognized that, should certain conditions be met, such a design could expedite the development of a drug aimed to treat cancer. (US FDA, March 2022).
The primary objectives of the current study are consistent with those typical of Phase 1/1b oncology studies, including characterizing the safety and tolerability of an Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP), establishing an MTD, and determining a recommended range of doses for evaluation in future clinical studies, based on PK and pharmacodynamic effects (Ahn 1998, Gatsonis 1992, Dillman 1992, ICH E8).
The Sponsor and Investigators will perform this study in compliance with the protocol, Good Clinical Practice (GCP), and International Council for Harmonization (ICH) guidelines, and applicable regulatory requirements.</DESCRIPTION>

    <DESCRIPTION>This phase III trial compares the effect of modified fluorouracil, leucovorin calcium, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan (mFOLFIRINOX) to modified fluorouracil, leucovorin calcium, and oxaliplatin (mFOLFOX) for the treatment of advanced, unresectable, or metastatic HER2 negative esophageal, gastroesophageal junction, and gastric adenocarcinoma. The usual approach for patients is treatment with FOLFOX chemotherapy. Chemotherapy drugs work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Fluorouracil stops cells from making DNA and it may kill tumor cells. Leucovorin is used with fluorouracil to enhance the effects of the drug. Oxaliplatin works by killing, stopping, or slowing the growth of tumor cells. Some patients also receive an immunotherapy drug, nivolumab, in addition to FOLFOX chemotherapy. Immunotherapy may induce changes in body's immune system and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Irinotecan blocks certain enzymes needed for cell division and DNA repair, and it may kill tumor cells. Adding irinotecan to the FOLFOX regimen could shrink the cancer and extend the life of patients with advanced gastroesophageal cancers.</DESCRIPTION>

N, M0 or any T, N3, M0 or select Stage III (ie, T3N1) according to the eighth edition of
the AJCC staging manual (TNM staging system).
4. Confirmation of acceptable FFPE tumor tissue sample to assess PD-L1 expression.
Samples must be acquired less than 3 months prior to first dose of cCRT. If such a sample
is not available, a fresh tumor biopsy is required 
5. For participants with OPC only: documented HPV status by IHC analysis with CINtecÂ®
Histology p16 Assay. If not available, a tumor tissue sample should be collected for
testing at the central laboratory </ELIGIBILITY>
    <DETAILED_ELIGIBILITY>1. Participants will have completed standard-of-care definitive cCRT with curative intent
within 12 weeks (84 days) prior to randomization as presented below. If baseline CT/MRI
images are equivocal and/or residual disease is suspected, investigators are strongly
recommended to perform an FDG-PET assessment to confirm absence of progression.
Where FDG-PET-avid lesions are detected and accessible, an endoscopy is recommended
to be performed and a biopsy taken as clinically indicated to confirm residual disease and
evaluate whether participation in this study is appropriate.
2. Participants must not have progressed following definitive cCRT therapy with curative
intent. Absence of recurrence and/or progression will be assessed by the following
imaging procedures up to 12 weeks after the last dose of cCRT.

    <DESCRIPTION>This phase III trial compares the addition of an immunotherapy drug (durvalumab) to usual chemotherapy versus usual chemotherapy alone in treating patients with MammaPrint Ultrahigh (MP2) stage II-III hormone receptor positive, HER2 negative breast cancer. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as durvalumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Chemotherapy drugs, such as paclitaxel, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. There is some evidence from previous clinical trials that people who have a MammaPrint Ultrahigh Risk result may be more likely to respond to chemotherapy and immunotherapy. Adding durvalumab to usual chemotherapy may be able to prevent the cancer from returning for patients with MP2 stage II-III hormone receptor positive, HER2 negative breast cancer.</DESCRIPTION>

    <DESCRIPTION>This phase II trial tests the safety, side effects, and best dose of monosialotetrahexosylganglioside (GM1) and whether it works in reducing or preventing chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) in patients with breast cancer that has spread from where it first started (primary site) to other places in the body (metastatic) who are receiving treatment with paclitaxel. Chemotherapy drugs, such as paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Exposure to chemotherapy drugs like paclitaxel may cause a side effect called CIPN, which is a condition of weakness, numbness, and pain from nerve damage (usually in the hands and feet). GM1 is a part of the body's natural system that insulates nerves and helps to protect nerves from damage. Giving GM1 may help reduce or prevent CIPN in breast cancer patients receiving treatment with paclitaxel.</DESCRIPTION>

    <DESCRIPTION>This phase II trial compares the combination of selinexor, daratumumab, Velcade (bortezomib), and dexamethasone (Dara-SVD) to the usual treatment of daratumumab, lenalidomide, bortezomib, and dexamethasone (Dara-RVD) in treating patients with high-risk newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. Selinexor is in a class of medications called selective inhibitors of nuclear export (SINE). It works by blocking a protein called CRM1, which may keep cancer cells from growing and may kill them. Daratumumab is in a class of medications called monoclonal antibodies. It binds to a protein called CD38, which is found on some types of immune cells and cancer cells, including myeloma cells. Daratumumab may block CD38 and help the immune system kill cancer cells. Bortezomib blocks several molecular pathways in a cell and may cause cancer cells to die. It is a type of proteasome inhibitor and a type of dipeptidyl boronic acid. Dexamethasone is in a class of medications called corticosteroids. It is used to reduce inflammation and lower the body's immune response to help lessen the side effects of chemotherapy drugs. Lenalidomide is in a class of medications called immunomodulatory agents. It works by helping the bone marrow to produce normal blood cells and by killing abnormal cells in the bone marrow. The drugs daratumumab, lenalidomide, bortezomib, dexamethasone and selinexor are already approved by the FDA for use in myeloma. But selinexor is not used until myeloma comes back (relapses) after initial treatment. Giving selinexor in the initial treatment may be a superior type of treatment for patients with high-risk newly diagnosed multiple myeloma.</DESCRIPTION>

    <DESCRIPTION>This phase II trial tests how well giving durvalumab with standard chemotherapy, gemcitabine and cisplatin, before surgery works in treating patients with high risk liver cancer (cholangiocarcinoma) that can be removed by surgery (resectable). Durvalumab is a monoclonal antibody that may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Chemotherapy drugs, such as gemcitabine and cisplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving durvalumab with gemcitabine and cisplatin before surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed in patients with high risk resectable cholangiocarcinoma.</DESCRIPTION>

    <DETAILED_ELIGIBILITY>Please note this may not be a complete list of eligibility criteria. We have included a few examples of study criteria to help you better understand how your eligibility in the study will be determined; your study team will go through the study eligibility criteria with you to verify if you qualify for participation in this study.

Inclusion Requirements
You can participate in this study if you
- Patients must have histologically documented nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) regardless of World Health Organization (WHO) classification (keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma, non-keratinizing, or basaloid squamous cell carcinoma) and regardless of association with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and/or human papillomavirus (HPV)
- Recurrent, metastatic and incurable disease treated with platinum-gemcitabine and prior PD-1/L1 blockade (as first or second-line therapy) where immunotherapy was part of the most recent prior line of therapy
- Patients are eligible regardless of prior smoking history, p16 immunohistochemistry (IHC) status, PD-L1 expression status, EBV tumor status, EBV viral load at baseline, or tumor genomic alteration status
- Patients must have at least one measurable lesion (by RECIST v1.1) which has not been previously irradiated that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded for non-nodal lesions as &gt;= 10 mm (&gt;= 1 cm) (and short axis for nodal lesions, LN &gt;= 15 mm) with CT scan, MRI, or calipers by clinical exam
- Patients may have had no more than 2 prior lines of prior systemic therapy for recurrent, metastatic NPC
- No prior VEGFR targeted therapy permitted
- Age &gt;= 18 years
- Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance (ECOG) performance status 0-2
- Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;= 1,000/mm^3
- Hemoglobin &gt;= 9 g/dL
- Platelet count &gt;= 100,000/mm^3
- Creatinine or creatinine clearance =&lt; 1.5 mg/dL or &gt;= 30 Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD)
- Total bilirubin =&lt; 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN); except subjects with Gilbert syndrome who can have a total bilirubin &lt; 3 mg/dL
- Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase [SGOT])/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase =&lt; 3 x upper limit of normal (ULN)
- Not pregnant and not nursing, because this study involves an investigational agent whose genotoxic, mutagenic and teratogenic effects on the developing fetus and newborn are unknown. Therefore, for women of childbearing potential only, a negative urine or serum pregnancy test, per institution standard, done =&lt; 7 days prior to registration is required.
- No active tumor bleeding: or radiographic evidence of major blood vessel infiltration as judged by the treating investigator
- Prior -anti-cancer therapy is allowed: Patients need to be recovered from adverse events due to prior anti-cancer therapy (i.e., have residual toxicities &gt; grade 1), with the exception of alopecia. Any life-threatening events clearly attributable to prior immunotherapy exposure that have a high possibility of recurring should warrant exclusion: including severe pneumonitis, grade 4 bullous dermatitis/drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), neurologic events such as autoimmune encephalitis transverse myelitis, and/or myocarditis. Maintenance hormonal replacement or long-term hormonal therapy exposure is permitted.
- No patients with a prior malignancy whose natural history or treatment has the potential to interfere with the safety or efficacy assessment of the investigational regimen
- Brain metastases allowed: Patients with treated brain metastases are eligible if follow-up brain imaging 4 weeks after central nervous system (CNS)-directed therapy shows no evidence of progression.
- Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients on effective anti-retroviral therapy with undetectable viral load within 6 months prior to registration are eligible for this trial</DETAILED_ELIGIBILITY>
    <DESCRIPTION>This phase II trial tests how well nivolumab and ipilimumab immunotherapy with or without cabozantinib in treating patients with nasopharyngeal cancer that has come back (after a period of improvement) (recurrent), has spread from where it first started (primary site) to other places in the body (metastatic), or for which no treatment is currently available (incurable). Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab and ipilimumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Cabozantinib is in a class of medications called kinase inhibitors. It works by blocking the action of an abnormal protein that signals cancer cells to multiply. This helps slow or stop the spread of cancer cells. Giving immunotherapy with nivolumab and ipilimumab and targeted therapy with cabozantinib may help shrink and stabilize nasopharyngeal cancer.</DESCRIPTION>

    <DESCRIPTION>This phase II trial tests how well darolutamide and leuprolide acetate work in treating patients with androgen receptor positive salivary cancer that has spread from where it first started (primary site) to other places in the body (metastatic), cannot be removed by surgery (unresectable) or that has come back after a period of responding to prior therapy (recurrent). Darolutamide is in a class of medications called androgen receptor inhibitors. It works by blocking the effects of androgen (a male reproductive hormone) to stop the growth and spread of cancer cells. Leuprolide acetate is in a class of medications called gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists. It works by decreasing the amount of certain hormones in the body. Giving darolutamide in combination with leuprolide acetate may help to stop the growth of tumor cells that need androgens to grow or shrink them.</DESCRIPTION>

    <DESCRIPTION>This phase II/III compares the standard therapy (chemotherapy plus cetuximab) versus adding bevacizumab to standard chemotherapy, versus combination of just bevacizumab and atezolizumab in treating patients with head and neck cancer that has spread to other places in the body (metastatic or advanced stage) or has come back after prior treatment (recurrent). Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as atezolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Bevacizumab is in a class of medications called antiangiogenic agents. It works by stopping the formation of blood vessels that bring oxygen and nutrients to tumor. This may slow the growth and spread of tumor. Cetuximab is in a class of medications called monoclonal antibodies. It binds to a protein called EGFR, which is found on some types of cancer cells. This may help keep cancer cells from growing. Cisplatin and carboplatin are in a class of chemotherapy medications known as platinum-containing compounds. They work by killing, stopping, or slowing the growth of cancer cells. Docetaxel is in a class of chemotherapy medications called taxanes. It stops cancer cells from growing and dividing and may kill them. The addition of bevacizumab to standard chemotherapy or combination therapy with bevacizumab and atezolizumab may be better than standard chemotherapy plus cetuximab in treating patients with recurrent/metastatic head and neck cancers.</DESCRIPTION>

    <DESCRIPTION>This phase III trial compares the usual chemotherapy treatment to eribulin plus gemcitabine in treating patients with urothelial cancer that has spread to other places in the body (metastatic). Chemotherapy drugs, such as eribulin, gemcitabine, docetaxel, paclitaxel, and sacituzumab govitecan work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. This trial aims to see whether adding eribulin to standard of care chemotherapy may work better in treating patients with metastatic urothelial cancer.</DESCRIPTION>

- Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected patients on effective anti-retroviral therapy with undetectable viral load within 6 months and CD4 T Cell count &gt; 200 cells/mm^3 are eligible for this trial. Testing is not required for entry into protocol
- Patients with a prior or concurrent malignancy whose natural history or treatment does not have the potential to interfere with the safety or efficacy assessment of the investigational regimen are eligible for this trial
- Negative urine or serum pregnancy test (in persons of childbearing potential) within 14 days prior to registration. Childbearing potential is defined as any person who has experienced menarche and who has not undergone surgical sterilization (hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy) or who is not postmenopausal. Menopause is defined clinically as 12 months of amenorrhea in a woman over 45 in the absence of other biological or physiological causes
- Willing to use highly effective contraceptives for participants of childbearing potential (participants who may become pregnant or who may impregnate a partner) during therapy and for 14 months (females); for 11 months (males) following last dose of cisplatin; this inclusion is necessary because the treatment in this study may be significantly teratogenic
- The patient or a legally authorized representative must provide study-specific informed consent prior to study entry and, for patients treated in the United States (U.S.), authorization permitting release of personal health information

Exclusion Requirements 
You cannot participate in this study if you:
- Patients with oral cavity cancer, nasopharynx cancer, or p16-negative cancer of unknown primary (CUP)
- Recurrence of the study cancer
- Definitive clinical or radiologic evidence of distant metastatic disease
- Prior systemic chemotherapy for the study cancer; note that prior chemotherapy for a different cancer is allowable, however, any prior exposure to cisplatin is excluded
- Prior radiotherapy to the region of the study cancer that would result in overlap of radiation therapy fields
- Severe, active co-morbidity
- Pregnancy and individuals unwilling to discontinue nursing
- History of hypersensitivity to cisplatin or platinum-containing compounds</DETAILED_ELIGIBILITY>
    <DESCRIPTION>This phase II/III trial compares the effect of the combination of high-dose cisplatin every three weeks and radiation therapy versus low-dose cisplatin weekly and radiation therapy for the treatment of patients with locoregionally advanced head and neck cancer. Chemotherapy drugs, such as cisplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. This study is being done to find out if low-dose cisplatin given weekly together with radiation therapy is the same or better than high-dose cisplatin given every 3 weeks together with radiation therapy in treating patients with head and neck cancer.</DESCRIPTION>

    <DESCRIPTION>The Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) established the Nulliparous Pregnancy Outcomes Study: Monitoring Mothers-to-be (nuMoM2b) to study women for whom the current pregnancy will lead to their first delivery (nulliparas). About 40% of pregnant women in the United States are nulliparas. Because little or no information from previous pregnancy outcomes is available to guide assignment of risk or mitigating interventions, adverse pregnancy outcomes in nulliparas are especially unpredictable. The underlying mechanisms of adverse pregnancy outcomes such as preterm birth, preeclampsia, fetal growth restriction and stillbirth are interrelated and therefore will be evaluated as part of this study. The information gained will benefit women who are pregnant or who are considering pregnancy and their physicians. In addition, the knowledge will support future research aimed at improving care and health outcomes for a critical group of at-risk women who are currently understudied.

The study is a prospective cohort study of a racially/ethnically/geographically diverse population of 10,038 nulliparous women with singleton gestations. The women undergo intensive research assessments during the course of their pregnancies to study the mechanisms for and prediction of adverse pregnancy outcomes (APOs) in women in their first pregnancy. The APOs of primary interest are preterm birth, preeclampsia and fetal growth restriction.

The goals of the study are to 1) determine maternal characteristics, including genetics, epigenetics, and physiological response to pregnancy as well as environmental factors that influence and/or predict adverse pregnancy outcome; 2) identify specific aspects of placental development and function that lead to adverse pregnancy outcome; and 3) characterize genetic, growth, and developmental parameters of the fetus that are associated with adverse pregnancy outcome.

Eight academic medical centers or sites had primary responsibility for enrollment and follow-up of study participants. Several of these sites collected data through additional academic research centers or nearby hospitals (subsites). A Data Coordinating and Analysis Center (DCAC) provided input to the protocol, manages the data, and analyzes the data. Investigators from these institutions have established a partnership with NICHD staff to develop and implement the study protocol and ancillary studies that acquire and analyze data to identify biomarkers and understand the mechanism and prediction of preterm birth and other adverse pregnancy outcomes.</DESCRIPTION>

    <SUMMARY>Forty percent of pregnant women in the United States are women who have never given birth. As a group, they sometimes have complications with their pregnancy, but there is no information from a previous pregnancy to identify who might have a problem. Very little research has been done with this group. The Nulliparous Pregnancy Outcomes Study: Monitoring Mothers-to-be (nuMoM2b) is collecting data from a diverse population of about 10,000 women who are having their first baby and are carrying only one baby. The women are enrolled early in pregnancy and undergo research assessments four times during their pregnancies. Data are collected through interviews, self-completed data forms, clinical measurements, ultrasound, and collection and storage of blood samples, urine samples, and fluid from the vagina and cervix. Some information comes from medical records. A subset of women may be asked to participate in substudies collecting information on sleep breathing, sleep patterns and quality, or other areas possibly related to birth outcomes. The goal of the research is to find ways to identify women in this group who might develop a problem with their pregnancy and use this information to improve the health of pregnant women and their babies in the future. The study is focusing on pregnancy problems like high blood pressure, babies that are born much too early and very small babies.</SUMMARY>

    <SUMMARY>Opioid antagonists at ultra-low doses have been used with opioid agonists to prevent or limit opioid tolerance. Remifentanil, a rapid onset/offset opioid that is often used as an anesthesia adjunct intraoperatively, has been associated with the development of hyperalgesia and opioid tolerance postoperatively. [1-4] Opioid-induced hyperalgesia (OIH) induced by remifentanil intraoperatively may be a factor contributing to an increase in postoperative pain as well as difficulty in controlling such pain. The purpose of this study will be to evaluate whether an ultra-low dose of naloxone, an opioid antagonist, could block remifentanil-induced hyperalgesia and tolerance following surgery.

This research will help elucidate the degree of OIH after surgeries involving remifentanil and determine if a new technique can be employed to decrease remifentanil-induced OIH.  By mitigating OIH, patients should have a decrease in postoperative pain and an increase in patient satisfaction at UCI and other hospitals where such a technique is employed.

    <DESCRIPTION>This study is researching an experimental drug called odronextamab, referred to as study drug. The study is focused on participants with previously untreated follicular lymphoma (a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma or NHL).

This study will be made up of two parts: Part 1 (non-randomized) and Part 2 (randomized - controlled). The aim of Part 1 of the study is to see how safe and tolerable the study drug is. The aim of Part 2 of the study is to see how the study drug works compared to rituximab and chemotherapy (the current standard of care for NHL). Standard of care means the usual medication expected and used when receiving treatment for a condition.

The study is looking at several other research questions, including:

What side effects may happen from taking the study drug
How much study drug is in your blood at different times
Whether the body makes antibodies against the study drug (which could make the drug less effective or could lead to side effects)
The impact from the study drug on your quality of life and ability to complete routine daily activities.</DESCRIPTION>

    <DESCRIPTION>This study is researching an experimental drug called odronextamab, referred to as study drug, when used in combination with chemotherapy. The study is focused on patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) that have not been treated before (called "previously untreated"), have come back after treatment (called "relapsed"), or have not responded to treatment (called "refractory").

This study will be made up of Part 1a, Part 1b, and Part 2.The aim of Part 1a and Part 1b of the study is to see how safe and tolerable the study drug in combination with chemotherapy is and to determine the dose and schedule of the study drug to be combined with chemotherapy in Part 2 of the study.

The aim of Part 2 of the study is to see how effective the combination of the study drug with chemotherapy is in comparison with the combination of rituximab and chemotherapy, the current standard of care treatment approved for Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Standard of care means the usual medication expected and used when receiving treatment for a condition.</DESCRIPTION>

    <DESCRIPTION>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common cancer worldwide and a leading cause of cancer-related death. The majority of participants first presenting with HCC have advanced unresectable or metastatic disease. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the optimized dose, adverse events, and efficacy of livmoniplimab in combination with budigalimab.

Livmoniplimab is an investigational drug being developed for the treatment of HCC. There are 3 treatment arms in this study and participants will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio. Participants will either receive livmoniplimab (at different doses) in combination with budigalimab (another investigational drug), lenvatinib, or sorafenib. Approximately 120 adult participants will be enrolled in the study across 60 sites worldwide.

In arm 1 (control), participants will receive the investigator's choice: lenvatinib as an oral capsule or sorafenib as an oral tablet, once daily. In arm 2, participants will receive intravenously (IV) infused livmoniplimab (dose A) in combination with IV infused budigalimab, every 3 weeks. In arm 3, participants will receive intravenously (IV) infused livmoniplimab (dose B) in combination with IV infused budigalimab, every 3 weeks. The estimated duration of the study is up to 2 years

There may be higher treatment burden for participants in this trial compared to their standard of care. Participants will attend regular visits during the study at a hospital or clinic and may require frequent medical assessments, blood tests, questionnaires, and scans.</DESCRIPTION>

    <DESCRIPTION>This phase II trial tests whether mosunetuzumab and/or polatuzumab vedotin helps benefit patients who have received chemotherapy (fludarabine and cyclophosphamide) followed by chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy (tisagenlecleucel, axicabtagene ciloleucel, or lisocabtagene maraleucel) for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma that has come back (recurrent) or that does not respond to treatment (refractory) or grade IIIb follicular lymphoma. Mosunetuzumab is a monoclonal antibody that may interfere with the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Polatuzumab vedotin is a monoclonal antibody, called polatuzumab, linked to a drug called vedotin. Polatuzumab is a form of targeted therapy because it attaches to specific molecules (receptors) on the surface of cancer cells, and delivers vedotin to kill them. Chemotherapy drugs, such as fludarabine and cyclophosphamide, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. CAR T-cell therapy is a type of treatment in which a patient's T cells (a type of immune system cell) are changed in the laboratory so they will attack cancer cells. T cells are taken from a patient's blood. Then the gene for a special receptor that binds to a certain protein on the patient's cancer cells is added to the T cells in the laboratory. The special receptor is called a chimeric antigen receptor. Large numbers of the CAR T cells are grown in the laboratory and given to the patient by infusion for treatment of certain cancers. Giving mosunetuzumab and/or polatuzumab vedotin after chemotherapy and CAR T-cell therapy may be more effective at controlling or shrinking the cancer than not giving them.</DESCRIPTION>

    <DESCRIPTION>The study has 2 parts. The first part is open to adults with different types of advanced cancer (solid tumours with changes in the HER2 gene) for whom previous treatment was not successful. The second part is open to people with non-small cell lung cancer with a specific mutation in the HER2 gene.

The purpose of the first study part is to find the highest dose of a medicine called BI 1810631 the participants can tolerate. Once this dose is found, it will be used in the second study part to tests whether BI 1810631 can make tumours shrink.

In this study, BI 1810631 is given to people for the first time. Participants take BI 1810631 as tablets once a day or twice a day.

The participants are in the study for as long as they benefit from and can tolerate treatment. Study doctors regularly check the participants' health and monitor the tumours. The doctors also take note of any unwanted effects that could have been caused by BI 1810631.</DESCRIPTION>

    <ELIGIBILITY>Patients must have a history of pathologically confirmed locally advanced/unresectable Merkel cell carcinoma or metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma.
Patients must have had prior treatment with anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L-1 antibody (e.g., pembrolizumab, avelumab, etc.) and have experienced progressive disease during treatment or within 120 days from the last dose of anti-PD-(L)1 therapy. 
Age18 years and over.
Patients must have adequate organ and marrow function

    <DETAILED_ELIGIBILITY>For patients with evidence of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, the HBV viral load must be undetectable on suppressive therapy, if indicated.
Patients with a history of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection must have been treated and cured. For patients with HCV infection who are currently on treatment, they are eligible if they have an undetectable HCV viral load.
Patients with treated brain metastases are eligible if follow-up brain imaging after central nervous system (CNS)-directed therapy shows no evidence of progression.
Patients with a prior or concurrent malignancy whose natural history or treatment does not have the potential to interfere with the safety or efficacy assessment of the investigational regimen are eligible for this trial.
Patients with known history or current symptoms of cardiac disease, or history of treatment with cardiotoxic agents, should have a clinical risk assessment of cardiac function using the New York Heart Association Functional Classification. To be eligible for this trial, patients should be class 2B or better.
Women of child-bearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and, for the duration of study participation, and 6 months after completion of M1774 and avelumab administration. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study participation, and 3 months after completion of M1774 and avelumab administration.
Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document. Legally authorized representatives may sign and give informed consent on behalf of study participants.</DETAILED_ELIGIBILITY>
    <DESCRIPTION>This is a randomized phase 2 clinical trial, where eligible patients who have progressed on anti-PD(L)1 therapy, will be randomized to monotherapy with M1774 or dual therapy with an M1774 plus avelumab. Randomization will be stratified on whether patients have primary ICI-refractory disease or acquired ICI-refractory disease. Randomization will be conducted using a permuted-block design with randomly chosen block sizes.
The primary objective of this phase 2 randomized clinical trial is to compare the efficacy of M1774 monotherapy to that of M1774 combined with avelumab therapy. The primary endpoint for these purposes will be the composite progression-free survival (PFS) with verified disease progression or death as components, and if each occurs the earliest of the two will be taken as the time of failure. The stratified (on disease, acquired versus primary ICI-refractory disease) log-rank test will be used to compare PFS between arms. The primary analysis will be done on an intent-to-treat basis. An as-treated analysis will also be done as a sensitivity analysis.
Secondary endpoints include the overall response rate (ORR) for all randomized patients, duration of response (DOR) for all randomized patients and overall survival (OS) for all randomized patients. Overall response rate is defined as described in Section 12.1, and for purposes of analysis and stopping rules (see below), ORR will be assessed at timepoints summarized in the protocol study calendar. M1774 alone or in combination with avelumab may induce durable radiographic responses to improve survival times for patients with MCC that has initial or acquired resistance to immune checkpoint inhibition. While secondary endpoints will be formally compared between arms, these outcomes will be more descriptive as the study is not powered to observe statistical differences in secondary endpoints between arms. However, time-to-event secondary outcomes will be compared using the stratified log-rank test, and the Mantel-Haenszel test (stratified on disease severity) will be used to compare binary outcomes.
The exploratory objectives are to examine the association of various immune correlates with the primary and secondary endpoint evaluated for M1774 alone or in combination with avelumab. All patients will be combined for these purposes, and separate examination of correlates will be conducted by treatment group to allow for the possibility that certain correlates will have differing associations with outcome according to treatment group.</DESCRIPTION>

    <DESCRIPTION>This phase I trial tests the safety, side effects, and best dose of novobiocin in treating cancer patients with alterations in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) repair genes. Novobiocin is an antibiotic that blocks the activity of a protein called DNA polymerase theta, which helps repair DNA that has become damaged as cells grow and divide. Cancer cells that cannot repair their damaged DNA die. This medication may help shrink or stabilize cancer with a mutation in DNA repair genes.</DESCRIPTION>

    <DESCRIPTION>This phase II trial tests whether decitabine and cedazuridine (ASTX727) in combination with venetoclax work better than ASTX727 alone at decreasing symptoms of bone marrow cancer in patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), myelodysplastic syndrome/myeloproliferative neoplasm (MDS/MPN) with excess blasts. Blasts are immature blood cells. Decitabine is in a class of medications called hypomethylation agents. It works by helping the bone marrow produce normal blood cells and by killing abnormal cells in the bone marrow. Cobimetinib is used in patients whose cancer has a mutated (changed) form of a gene called BRAF. It is in a class of medications called kinase inhibitors. It works by blocking the action of an abnormal protein that signals cancer cells to multiply. This helps slow or stop the spread of cancer cells. Venetoclax is in a class of medications called B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) inhibitors. It may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking Bcl-2, a protein needed for cancer cell survival. The combination of ASTX727 and venetoclax may be more effective in reducing the cancer signs and symptoms in patients with CMML, or MDS/MPN with excess blasts</DESCRIPTION>

-Participants must not have undergone any prior systemic therapy for HCC including chemotherapy, immunotherapy, biologic therapy, hormonal therapy, herbal therapy, or investigational agents. 
</DETAILED_ELIGIBILITY>
    <DESCRIPTION>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common cancer worldwide and a leading cause of cancer-related death. The majority of participants first presenting with HCC have advanced unresectable or metastatic disease. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the optimized dose, adverse events, and efficacy of livmoniplimab in combination with budigalimab.

Livmoniplimab is an investigational drug being developed for the treatment of HCC. There are 2 stages to this study. In Stage 1, there are 3 treatment arms and participants will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio. Participants will either receive livmoniplimab (at different doses) in combination with budigalimab (another investigational drug), atezolizumab in combination with bevacizumab, or tremelimumab in combination with durvalumab. In Stage 2, there are 2 treatments arms and participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio. Participants will either receive livmoniplimab (optimized dose) in combination with budigalimab or tremelimumab in combination with durvalumab. Approximately 660 adult participants will be enrolled in the study across 185 sites worldwide.

Stage 1: In arm 1, participants will receive intravenously (IV) infused livmoniplimab (Dose 1) in combination with IV infused budigalimab, every 3 weeks. In arm 2, participants will receive IV infused livmoniplimab (Dose 2) in combination with IV infused budigalimab, every 3 weeks. In Arm 3 (control), participants will receive the investigator's choice: IV atezolizumab in combination with IV bevacizumab every 3 weeks or single dose IV tremelimumab in combination with IV durvalumab every 4 weeks. Stage 2: In arm 1, participants will receive IV infused livmoniplimab (optimized dose) in combination with IV infused budigalimab, every 3 weeks. In Arm 2 (control), participants will receive single dose IV tremelimumab in combination with IV durvalumab every 4 weeks. All participants will continue treatment until disease progression or discontinuation criteria are met, whichever occurs first. The estimated duration of this study is about 56 months.

There may be higher treatment burden for participants in this trial compared to their standard of care. Participants will attend regular visits during the study at a hospital or clinic and may require frequent medical assessments, blood tests, questionnaires, and scans.</DESCRIPTION>

    <DESCRIPTION>This clinical trial is studying solid tumor cancers. A solid tumor is one that starts in part of your body like your lungs or liver instead of your blood. Once they've grown bigger in one spot or spread to other parts of the body, they're harder to treat. This is called advanced or metastatic cancer.

Participants in this study must have breast cancer or gastric cancer. Participants must have tumors that have HER2 on them. This allows the cancer to grow more quickly or spread faster. There are few treatment options for patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors that express HER2.

This clinical trial uses an experimental drug called disitamab vedotin (DV). Disitamab vedotin is a type of antibody drug conjugate or ADC. ADCs are designed to stick to cancer cells and kill them.

This clinical trial uses a drug called tucatinib, which has been approved to treat cancer in the United States and some other countries. This drug is sold under the brand name TUKYSAÂ®.

This study will test how safe and how well DV, with or without tucatinib, is for participants with solid tumors. This study will also test what side effects happen when participants take these drugs. A side effect is anything a drug does to the body besides treating the disease.</DESCRIPTION>

    <DESCRIPTION>This phase III trial compares perioperative chemotherapy (given before and after surgery) versus adjuvant chemotherapy (given after surgery) for the treatment of pancreatic cancer that can be removed by surgery (removable/resectable). Chemotherapy drugs, such as fluorouracil, irinotecan, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving chemotherapy before and after surgery (perioperatively) may work better in treating patients with pancreatic cancer compared to giving chemotherapy after surgery (adjuvantly).</DESCRIPTION>

2.  Pregnant women
3.  less than 18 years of age of more than 80 years of age
4.  Hunt Hess Grade 5 SAH
5.  Intra-arterial drug treatment in all 3 arterial territories</DETAILED_ELIGIBILITY>
    <DESCRIPTION>The primary objective of the study is to determine the optimal intra-arterial drug treatment regimen for arterial lumen restoration post cerebral vasospasm following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.

The secondary objective is to evaluate clinical outcome at 90 days post discharge following optimal intra-arterial drug treatment for cerebral vasospasm.

This study is a prospective multicenter randomized trial. The primary outcome measure is the Post infusion improvement ratio (PIIR) assessed 10 minutes after completion of the intra-arterial infusion. PIIR is a measure of arterial lumen diameter pre and post intra-arterial drug infusion in the presenting vasospasmic blood vessel.

Modified Rankin score (mRS) at 3 months post hospital discharge will be recorded as a secondary outcome to assess clinical outcome.

The interventions in this study are a part of routine standard of care (SOC) procedures for cerebral vasospasm treatment. Following surgical or endovascular intervention for aneurysmal Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (aSAH) if patients develop cerebral vasospasm refractory to maximal medical management, endovascular treatment by intra-arterial drug infusion of single drug agent or cocktail drug agents will be initiated.

Study participants will be randomly assigned to one of the three treatment groups where one single drug agent or cocktail drug agents will be intra-arterially administered. Pre &amp; post infusion vasospasmic vessel diameters will be compared. The change in diameter will be quantified based on the mean percentage change. Three months post hospital discharge, study participants will be followed up in clinic to evaluate clinical outcome.

The study will require 330 patients in total. The patient population will be hospitalized patients presenting with cerebral vasospasm post aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.

Subjects will be stratified by randomization into 3 treatment groups.

    <DESCRIPTION>The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of efavaleukin alfa on induction of clinical remission in participants with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (UC).

Participants will be randomized to receive 1 of 3 efavaleukin alfa doses or placebo during a 12-week induction period. Participants who complete the 12-week induction period will have the option to enter an exploratory long-term treatment period for up to 40 weeks (total of up to 52 weeks of treatment) if, in the opinion of the investigator, they may benefit from continued treatment. During the long-term period, participants randomized to efavaleukin alfa will remain on the same efavaleukin alfa blinded dose; participants randomized to placebo who achieved clinical response at week 12 will remain on placebo; and placebo non-responders (ie, participants randomized to placebo who did not achieve clinical response at week 12) will receive efavaleukin alfa in a blinded manner during continued treatment. All participants will complete a safety follow-up visit 6 weeks after their last dose of investigational product.

    <DESCRIPTION>This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase III study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of anifrolumab in the treatment of adult participants with Systemic Sclerosis (SSc) who may be taking one or a combination of protocol-specified standard therapies. The use of one of the following standard immunosuppressant therapies is permitted at a stable dose, but not mandated: hydroxychloroquine, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), mycophenolic acid or mycophenolate sodium (MPA), methotrexate, azathioprine, tacrolimus, and oral glucocorticoids. MMF or MPA, azathioprine, and methotrexate may be used in combination with hydroxychloroquine and/or low-dose oral glucocorticoids [less than or equal to 10 mg/day].

Approximately 306 eligible participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either 120 mg anifrolumab (or matching placebo) given subcutaneously once weekly for 52 weeks. The study will be stratified by the following factors:

1.  Interstitial lung disease (ILD) (yes, no) at Week 0 (Day1);
2.  MMF or MPA use (yes ,no) at Week 0 (Day 1); and
3.  Disease duration, defined as the time from the first non-Raynaud's symptom attributable to SSc (&lt;18 months, greater than or equal to 18 months) at Week 0 (Day 1)

Study treatment will be administered subcutaneously via an accessorized prefilled syringe by study staff or by the participant or carer, either in the clinic or at home, with most doses being administered at home. The study consists of 4 periods: a 6-week screening period, a 52-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled period, a 52-week open-label active treatment period, and a 12-week safety follow-up period. There are a total of 16 study visits with most visits in the treatment period occurring every 8 to 12 weeks. The periods are described below:

1.  Screening Period: This may involve one or more visits to the study site.
2.  Double Blind Treatment Period: Treatment Period when participants will receive once weekly injections of anifrolumab or matching placebo. Participation will involve in-clinic study visits at Weeks 0 (Day 1), 1, 4, 8*, 16, 24, 36, 48 and 52. *The visit at Week 8 may be either by telephone or in person.
3.  Open Label Treatment Period: At Week 52, all participants will be given anifrolumab 120 mg (subcutaneous) once weekly for 52 weeks (last dose at Week 103). Participation will involve in-clinic study visits at Weeks 52, 56, 64, 76. 88 and 104.
4.  Safety Follow-up Period: All participants will return to the clinic for a 12-week post treatment visit. This will occur post 5.  Double Blind Treatment Period (Week 52 or Double Blind Period early discontinuation) or post Open Label Treatment 6.  Period (Week 104 or Open Label Period early discontinuation).</DESCRIPTION>

55 Years to 90 Years (Adult,  Older Adult )</ELIGIBILITY>
    <DETAILED_ELIGIBILITY>Inclusion Criteria:

Diagnosis of a MCI:  
1.  Participants must have subjective memory concern reported by participant, study partner, or clinician.
2.  A mini-mental state exam between &gt;/= 22 for subjects with more than 8 years of education. For subjects with less than 8 years of education, a MMSE &gt;/= 20 will be allowed.
3.  Clinical Dementia Rating 0.5. The memory box score must be at least 0.5.
4.  General cognition and functional performance sufficiently preserved such that a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease cannot be made by the site physician at the time of the screening visit.
5.  Abnormal memory function documented by scoring within the education adjusted ranges on the Logical Memory II subscale (Delayed 6.  Paragraph Recall, Paragraph A only) from the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised.

a) For early MCI:
.  9-11 for 16 or more years of education
.  5-9 for 8-15 years of education
.  3-6 for 0-7 years of education

b)For late MCI
.  &gt;/= 8 for 16 or more years of education

10.  Participants without a known history of diabetes. If diabetes is diagnosed during screening (hemoglobin A1c of 6.5 % or greater) they will also be excluded. The main justification for this exclusion is the potential for these participants to be placed on other diabetes medications that may confound our study.
11.  General cognition and functional performance such that a diagnosis of dementia cannot be made at the time of screening based on DSM-V criteria.
12.  Vision and hearing must be sufficient for compliance with testing procedures.

    <DESCRIPTION>MAP will be a multisite phase II/III 1:1 randomized controlled trial (RCT) of long acting metformin (reduced mass Glucophage XR) vs. matching placebo in 326 men and women with early and late aMCI, without diabetes, not treated with metformin, overweight or obese, aged 55 years to 90 years. The RCT will last 18 months and have 4 visits: baseline, 6-months, 12-months, and 18-months. The RCT will be preceded by a screening phase followed by randomization and a titration period in which drug/placebo will be titrated from 500 mg a day (one tablet) to 2,000 mg a day (4 tablets), in increments of 500 mg (one tablet) every 10 days. Participants will remain in the RCT on the tolerated dose, and included in analyses on an intent to treat basis. We expect the attrition rate to be 10%/year. Neuropsychological battery, clinical interviews, physical exam, and phlebotomy will be conducted at baseline and every 6 months. Brain MRI will be conducted in approximately half of the participants (186) twice, at baseline, and after the last study visit at month 18. We will also conduct brain amyloid Positron Emission Tomography (PET) using 18F-Florbetaben, and tau PET using 18F-MK6240 in half of the participants at baseline and end of the RCT. The primary clinical outcome of the study will be changes in the Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test. The secondary clinical outcome will be changes in the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Preclinical Alzheimer's Cognitive Composite. Secondary subclinical outcomes will be changes in cortical thickness AD signature areas, changes in white matter hyperintensity volume, changes in brain amyloid burden, changes in brain tau burden, and changes in plasma biomarkers of amyloid, tau, and neurodegeneration. The data coordinating center and Imaging Core is located at John Hopkins University. The PET coordinating center is located at UC-Berkeley. The Clinical Coordinating and Monitoring Center and the central laboratory will be located at Columbia. The Research pharmacy function will be shared by the University of Rochester, which will dispense randomization kits, and the University of Iowa, which will receive bulk metformin and identical matching placebo from EMD Serono.
